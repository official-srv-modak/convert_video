00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,167
So I guess this is it.

3
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,433
Yeah.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,100
I guess so.

5
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,367
Well, do you guys have to go
to the new house right away

6
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:37,267
or do you have some time?

7
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,533
We got some time.

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
Okay, should we
get some coffee?

9
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:47,733
Sure.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,033
Where?

11
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,633
Wow.

12
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,633
Wow.

13
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,467
I mean, this is beautiful.

14
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,467
It's beautiful.
Look at that.

15
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, man.

16
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:29,667
So many... So many different
episodes are like

17
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,800
you know,
Lisa playing guitar up there,

18
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,733
Jen and I, our first kiss,

19
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,700
like, the pilot,
opening the umbrella.

20
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,167
I mean, come on.

21
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,167
Yeah.

22
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,667
Where is everyone?

23
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,667
Come on, I want to see everyone.

24
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,100
Oh, my God.

25
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,567
Oh!

26
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,833
That "Oh!"

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
This is all I care about.

28
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,567
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:06,633
Oh, my God.

30
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,100
Hello.
Oh, you smell good, too.

31
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,833
Yeah, so do you.

32
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,967
Look at that.

33
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,367
Wasn't there a decision
to lose this?

34
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:17,533
Yes, I thought this was gone.

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,533
This was here in the beginning,
and...

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,667
- It kept, like...
- Got in the way.

37
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,000
It got in the way. Yeah.

38
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,767
Sorry, you got lost
behind the beam.

39
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,200
As it's probably
getting in the way now.

40
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,233
- Well, I don't know.
- Oh.

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,367
- Sometimes it's a choice.
- There we go.

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,133
- Ee, ee, ee.
- How crazy is this?

43
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:50,967
I hear someone.

44
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,033
I just started crying.

45
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,467
Floosh!

46
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:55,467
Joo!

47
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,433
It's amazing.

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,400
- Hi.
- How are you?

49
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:07,733
Ooh. Holy crap.

50
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,433
Oh, weird.

51
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,933
Alright, well,
where's the tissue box?

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,100
Uh-oh.

53
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,300
- Oh!
- Hey!

54
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,033
What are you guys doing here?

55
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,233
Waiting for you.

56
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,767
Oh, my God.
How are you?

57
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,600
Oh, look at you.

58
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:38,300
- Look at you.
- Hello. Big blue.

59
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,667
This is great.

60
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,800
This is too weird.

61
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:44,433
Look at this.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,700
Remember when we all used
to fit through that door?

63
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:52,067
- Oh.
- I got chills.

64
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,433
It's so weird.
Walk that way, buddy.

65
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,100
Look at this.

66
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,967
Does Courteney still have her
lines written on the table?

67
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,367
Do you know what
the difference is?

68
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,367
You know what's nuts?
Oh, really?

69
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,767
I never knew she did that.
And I saw it.

70
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,067
I was like, "What is this?"
She goes...

71
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,467
"Mind your business," she said.

72
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,933
So before we shot that night,
I erased it all.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,333
- No.
- And she got so mad at me.

74
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
Or had the script
in the sink.

75
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,300
- That I do remember.
- That I remember.

76
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,267
There was always
a script in the sink.

77
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,867
- I didn't know why.
- That was Courteney's script.

78
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,267
Good for her.

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,633
Oh, my God.

80
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,833
- Really?
- C.C.!

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
- Did you cry too?
- Yes.

82
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,433
Okay, good.

83
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,967
Of course I did.

84
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,667
How are you? Ohh.

85
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,100
Wow.

86
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,467
I know.
It's worse than you imagine.

87
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,300
- Look at you.
- Oh, you do smell good, Court.

88
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:51,833
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh. That's crazy.

89
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,333
- Do you remember that night?
- What?

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,033
You had... I don't remember
what episode it was.

91
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,933
But you had this, like,
big speech,

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,700
and you were struggling
with it all week long,

93
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,700
and you wrote it on the table,

94
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,667
and then just... and I didn't
know that that's what you did.

95
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:08,967
And I saw it and I asked you,

96
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,733
and you told me
to mind my business.

97
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,167
So when you weren't looking,
I erased it before we shot.

98
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,833
- That's so mean.
- And you got so mad at me.

99
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,033
I didn't know you did that.

100
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,533
Why would you erase it?

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,667
Just to get you.

102
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,600
God, I had so many...

103
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:26,100
so much of my dialogue
within these apples.

104
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,533
- I didn't know.
- Oh, sometimes, yeah.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,367
I have memory issues.

106
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,233
Matthew Perry's here.

107
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,067
Hello.

108
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,633
- Hey, Matt.
- Matty!

109
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,333
Looshy. Hi.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,167
Could you <i>be</i> any later?

111
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:44,800
- Hey.
- How are you, brother?

112
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:45,900
Hey.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,433
- How are you, bud?
- Good.

114
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,667
Look at all of us.

115
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:52,900
- Oh, my God.
- This is crazy.

116
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,867
Does it seem smaller
to anyone else?

117
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,300
From here to over there.

118
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,733
- Does not feel smaller.
- No.

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,867
It feels the same to me.

120
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,400
And was it always purple,
that wall?

121
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:01,700
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

122
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:02,967
Yeah, you've gone crazy.

123
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,500
I mean, this is incredible.

124
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,833
Yeah, it really is.
The whole thing.

125
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Just really...

126
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,900
Oh, the one thing missing...

127
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:13,567
the original cookie jar
is at Lisa Kudrow's house.

128
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,867
Did you take anything
from the set besides...

129
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,900
I took a neon coffee mug.

130
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,800
I have the original ball
from the foosball table.

131
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,167
You look at it and go,
"What is that old, crappy ..."

132
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,433
Should have taken
the whole table.

133
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,533
We smashed it, remember?

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,933
By the end, it got smashed.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
- Oh, it did?
- Then what's that?

136
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,667
Well, that was before
it got destroyed.

137
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,233
We're going back
a little further.

138
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,333
I need to watch this series.

139
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,033
- It was good.
- I have the original ball.

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,633
- Yeah, yeah.
- It had its moments.

141
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,800

Take a seat.

177
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,333
Look at this.
Look at all of you.

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,467
Hello.

179
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:58,300
Hello, James Corden.

180
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,667
I cannot tell you
how incredible it is

181
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:04,667
to be here with all of you now.

182
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:07,100
And we are... I should say
we are shooting now

183
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:10,033
in front of the iconic fountain

184
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,867
where you shot
the opening credits.

185
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,833
It's beautiful and it's lovely.

186
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,100
It is, however, noisy...

187
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,700
- Yes.
- ...and difficult...

188
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,167
difficult to conduct
an interview.

189
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:24,900
So if you'll just wait,
watch this.

190
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,433
Watch this for power.
Wait there.

191
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:36,467
Done. Okay.

192
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,900
That's superpowers.

193
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:40,700
- Alright. I know. I know.
- Those are superpowers.

194
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,967
You still got it.

195
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,667
- I know.
- Had we known

196
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:46,900
all those years ago.

197
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,733
Now, how are we doing?

198
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,633
This has been an emotional day
for all of you.

199
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,500
How are you feeling
to be together,

200
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,767
the six of you right now?

201
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,833
It's been so fantastic
and exciting.

202
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,533
And we've literally just
sort of slipped right back

203
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,533
right... as we usually do.

204
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,567
David, how have you
found this time?

205
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:11,533
Really emotional.
Really, really fun, actually.

206
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,033
I felt, after the initial shock

207
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,167
of just being
in the same room together,

208
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:21,133
just I think we all just fell
right into our same old...

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,367
our same old kind of joking
around like we're a family.

210
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,300
- And so it really was...
- Regressed. We regressed.

211
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,500
- We regressed, yeah.
- Back to 20s.

212
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,700
How much do you
stay in touch?

213
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:34,933
Yeah, no,
we stay in touch for sure.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,767
- Maybe not every day.
- Sure.

215
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:40,100
But, you know,
we have such a bond

216
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,600
from having done this show

217
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,500
and forged
this very tight relationship

218
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,433
that, you know,
any time you text

219
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,667
or call someone,
they're going to pick up.

220
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:54,233
- They'll be there.
- Matthew, who doesn't pick up?

221
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,133
I don't hear from anyone.

222
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:04,900
Now, I'm going to
give you some stats, okay?

223
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:09,333
So "Friends," you made
236 episodes of the show.

224
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,467
It aired in
over 220 territories.

225
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:18,100
"Friends" was TV's number-one
comedy for six straight seasons,

226
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:21,567
averaging 25 million viewers
a week.

227
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:25,933
52 million people
watched the finale.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,667
The show has been watched
over 100 billion times

229
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,633
across all platforms.

230
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,267
- And tonight...
- That's a lot.

231
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,867
- That's a lot.
- ...is a real

232
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,500
celebration of that.

233
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,867
And the creators of the show
are here tonight

234
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,267
sat in the audience.

235
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:49,000
Marta Kauffman, David Crane,
Kevin Bright are just sat there.

236
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,200
They created the show.

237
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,433
I'm the executive producer

238
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,700
and sometimes director
of "Friends."

239
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,100
My name is Kevin Bright.

240
00:13:05,933 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm co-creator,
executive producer,

241
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,033
and writer Marta Kauffman.

242
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:16,033
I'm the co-creator and
executive producer of "Friends."

243
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,733
I'm David Crane.

244
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Marta and I spent our 20s
living in New York.

245
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,767
We had a tight
circle of friends.

246
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,633
There we were in our 20s
in New York

247
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,767
trying to make a living
and find love.

248
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,533
And we thought
that could be a show.

249
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,767
We drew on relatives of ours
and friends of ours

250
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,033
and names were...

251
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,633
We named Chandler
after a friend of mine.

252
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,967
I mean, we definitely
pulled from our lives.

253
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,633
We really were intrigued
with the idea

254
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,267
of doing a true ensemble.

255
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,833
It's not like there's a lead
and they have friends.

256
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,033
No, it's just about the friends.

257
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,033
We're following
all of their stories equally,

258
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
which we felt like
we hadn't seen before.

259
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:02,067
The one-sentence pitch is it's
about that time in your life

260
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,767
when your friends
are your family.

261
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,933
- Want to see this area?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,300
I knew you were
gonna do it.

263
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:16,767
When did you knock?

264
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:20,267
Only in the reunion.

265
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,900
Wow-ee.

266
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:26,767
Oh, the beam is back.

267
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,267
Memories just flashed back

268
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,033
of, like, jokes coming out
of the bathroom.

269
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
- I know, the bathroom.
- "Oh, do not ..."

270
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:37,767
Just, like, stupid things
that you would do.

271
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,867
Oh.

272
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,667
Did you go next door?

273
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,300
- I have not.
- Come on.

274
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,400
What's back here?

275
00:14:46,467 --> 00:14:50,233
Look at the chairs.
The chairs are here.

276
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,367
Ohh, yeah, oh, yeah.

277
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,300
These I think can be operated
by just one person.

278
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,700
But back then,
we had three per camera.

279
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,233
It was a huge crew.

280
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,900
Four cameras, like,
the choreography was incredible.

281
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,100
- Ohhh.
- Ohhh.

282
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,967
Ohh. Ohh.

283
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Do you remember
the episode where

284
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,433
we never got out of the chairs?

285
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,267
Yeah.

286
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
Pizza's on the way.

287
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,400
I told you
we wouldn't have to get up.

288
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,667
But you remember the beginning
of the week

289
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,500
after the table draft,
you came to me and you go,

290
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:23,733
"It's so stupid."

291
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,233
I was like, "Yeah,
but that's the brilliance."

292
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,533
And you were like, "Maybe
we can have fun with this."

293
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,967
And then we had a blast.

294
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,967
What if we have to pee?

295
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,267
I'll cancel the sodas.

296
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,900
Oh, they're sitting
in their chairs.

297
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:43,733
No, they aren't.
Are they really?

298
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,133
Oh, Matty,
it's good to see you, man.

299
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
This is great.

300
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:50,333
Schwimmer, the episode where
you guys were throwing a ball

301
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,733
and the whole time,
you couldn't drop the ball.

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,467
I don't remember that.

303
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,667
- Let me ask the boys.
- What kind of ball?

304
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,000
It was like a Nerf ball.

305
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:01,333
Hey, guys.
Hey, do you remember the one

306
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,367
where you guys were throwing
a ball back and forth

307
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,567
- and you couldn't drop the ball?
- Couldn't drop the ball, yeah.

308
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,900
- Yes.
- So it was you two.

309
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,967
Everybody ended up
getting in on it.

310
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,233
- Schwimmer was in on it.
- No memory.

311
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,400
You want to
get something to eat?

312
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,533
Or you want to see how long

313
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,733
we can throw this ball
back and forth?

314
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,633
- The ball thing.
- Yeah?

315
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,467
This is how old we are.
This is what laptops were.

316
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:23,000
No, I remember that.

317
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,800
It's so heavy.

318
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,333
Let's go look at
the dressing rooms.

319
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,667
- This is Jennifer's forever.
- My room.

320
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,167
Those are my hardwood floors.

321
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,200
You guys ate lunch
together every day.

322
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:36,100
- Yeah, we did.
- First couple of years,

323
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,133
like, we ate
every meal together.

324
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,567
That's right.

325
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,367
- Even on the weekend.
- We watched every show together.

326
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,867
We were inseparable, all of us.

327
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,633
Big center table here,
and Enger would cook...

328
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,833
It all seems small to me,
the whole stage.

329
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
No, that's impossible, though,

330
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:52,567
because we haven't grown.

331
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:56,233
- Well, speak for yourself.
- Shut up.

332
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,933
Let's talk about
favorite episodes.

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,433
Everybody's got
their favorite episodes.

334
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,367
I'm keen to know what are yours.

335
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:08,867
I love the Thanksgiving ones,
but I also... I loved

336
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,067
when we traded...
when we lost the apartment.

337
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,167
The quiz, the embryos.

338
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,133
Yeah, the one with the embryos.

339
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,367
Yeah, but that quiz was really
fun and really devastating.

340
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,333
Yeah.

341
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,733
I just can't believe
that you think

342
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,367
that you and Chandler
know me and Rachel better

343
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,433
than we know you.

344
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,133
Well, we do.

345
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,200
What is Monica's
biggest pet peeve?

346
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,733
- Animals dressed as humans.
- That's correct.

347
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,733
What name appears
on the address label?

348
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,833
- It's Chandler Bing!
- No!

349
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,633
Actually,
it's "Miss Chanandler Bond."

350
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,400
If we win, they have to get rid
of the rooster.

351
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:49,200
- Ooh, that's interesting.
- But if we win...

352
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,433
we get your apartment.

353
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,800
What is Chandler Bing's job?

354
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,333
Oh, oh, he's a transponds...
transponster!

355
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:00,533
That's not even a word!

356
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,967
- No!
- Oh, my God.

357
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:05,400
- Yes!
- Whoo!

358
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:14,167
Okay, the test is ready.

359
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:18,067
Each team will answer
a set of trivia questions, okay?

360
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:21,800
The categories are
"Fears and Pet Peeves,"

361
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,733
- "Ancient History"...
- Oh, no!

362
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,033
- ..."Literature"...
- Uh-oh.

363
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,533
- ...and "It's All Relative."
- Okay.

364
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,133
Now the coin toss
to see who goes first.

365
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,733
Okay.

366
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,033
Okay, somebody call it
this time.

367
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,467
- Oh, sorry.
- Okay, here we go.

368
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,067
Okay.

369
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,533
Heads.

370
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
Oh, it's tails,
and the boys go first.

371
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,033
Alright. Okay.

372
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,433
Okay, here we go.
Pick your category.

373
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,633
- Ancient History.
- Alright.

374
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,233
"Rachel wrote Ross a letter
and demanded he read it

375
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,900
before they got back together.

376
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,600
How many pages was that letter?"

377
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,933
18 pages.

378
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Damn.

379
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:00,233
- 18 pages...
- Front and back!

380
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,600
Front and back is correct.

381
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:05,733
Oh, my God, that's good.

382
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,133
- This is the letter.
- Is that the letter?

383
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,133
This is the letter.

384
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,400
Who gets the points for that?

385
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:10,567
- What?
- Me.

386
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:12,167
Okay, ladies, pick a category.

387
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,933
- It's All Relative.
- It's All Relative.

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,700
- Alright.
- Yes.

389
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,433
"Ladies, can you name
this voice?"

390
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,567
That's my monkey.

391
00:19:21,633 --> 00:19:24,233
Oh! Mr... Mr. Henkel.

392
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
- Mr. Winkel... Hinkel?
- Hinkel.

393
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,633
- Wait. No, no, no. Really?
- No? What's his name?

394
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,967
Wait, wait.
Do it one more time.

395
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,367
Can we hear it again?

396
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,600
We know it. We know it.

397
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,833
No, wait, "That's my monkey."

398
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,667
It's the guy who lives
downstairs.

399
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:37,967
- And his name would be...?
- Mr. Rickles.

400
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:39,633
- No.
- I know it. I know it.

401
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,200
I know it!

402
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,500
It's not your turn!

403
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:46,833
No, will, the mystery voice
please reveal himself?

404
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:02,300
It's Larry Hankin
back as Mr. Heckles.

405
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,500
Heckles!

406
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:04,667
I said Larry Hankin.

407
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,533
You all owe me a cat
and a waffle.

408
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,733
Larry Hankin, everyone.

409
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,367
But why didn't I get points
for getting the name right?!

410
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,133
Alright, okay, guys,
you're up.

411
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,267
- Literature.
- Literature.

412
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,467
Oh, that's a good choice,
gentlemen.

413
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,300
- Thank you.
- Literature.

414
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:24,533
"According to Monica,
how many erogenous zones

415
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,833
- are there on the female body?"
- Seven.

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,733
Courteney, Courteney,
is that correct?

417
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,100
That's correct. Seven.

418
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,933
Alright, ladies.

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,167
- Ancient History.
- Ancient History.

420
00:20:40,233 --> 00:20:41,400
Oh, you know what?

421
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,267
I'm... I'm gonna need
a little help

422
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,900
- with this question.
- Oh, dear.

423
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,333
Gentlemen.

424
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,167
- Oh.
- Oh!

425
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,700
"This very barbershop quartet
famously delivered

426
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,867

427

but can you
complete the lyrics?"

428
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:04,767

Thanks, guys.

447
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

448
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,233
I think "Friends"
has this magic

449
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,767
because each character
is so distinct

450
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,100
that they could hold
a television show by themselves.

451
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,800
Yes?

452
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:13,633
Hi. Is Rachel here?
I'm her sister.

453
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,867
When my agent
called me and said,

454
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,067
"Do you want to play

455
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,933
Rachel Green's sister
on 'Friends, '"

456
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
I was like,
"Have I won the lottery?"

457
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:21,800
Which sister is this?

458
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:24,733
Is this the spoiled one
or the one that bit her?

459
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,733
- Daddy cut me off.
- Never mind. I got it.

460
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,667
Okay, so one of the most
exciting things was I got

461
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,833
to be in this scene
where I'm in the apartment

462
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,433
and Joey walks in and he goes...

463
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,567
Hey, how you doin'?

464
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:37,967
Don't.

465
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,933
And it was his iconic line
and I was so excited.

466
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,600
And to watch a famous character
say his famous line, come on.

467
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,333
Hey, it's Phoebe.

468
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,267
We can talk to Phoebe.

469
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:58,733
If you think about Monica
or Phoebe or Rachel,

470
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,133
each one of them
is a leading character.

471
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,767
But together, you get this great
repartee, all the actors

472
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,467
at the top of their game,
and great chemistry.

473
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:09,867
Alright.

474
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:12,733
No!
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

475
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,900
They'll never understand.

476
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,667
We have to say something.

477
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,933
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

478
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,867
They were funny,
they were engaging,

479
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,800
they knew
their characters so well,

480
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,600
but they also worked
so well together.

481
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:32,333
There was a real sense
of love for each other.

482
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
- Monica...
- Bigger, louder.

483
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,600
...got stung by a jellyfish.

484
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,700
Alright.

485
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,600
I got stung.

486
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,733
Stung bad.

487
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,067
I couldn't stand.
I couldn't... I couldn't walk.

488
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,733
We were two miles
from the house.

489
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,167
We were scared and alone.

490
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,833
We didn't think
we could make it.

491
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,133
I was in too much pain.

492
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,900
And I was tired from digging
the huge hole.

493
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:01,467
And then Joey
remembered something.

494
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:04,167
I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

495
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:07,500
Wait a minute. I saw that
on the Discovery Channel.

496
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:12,700
Yeah.
About jellyfish and how if y...

497
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:15,633
- Eww.
- Eww!

498
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
You... You peed on yourself?

499
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:20,067
Eww!

500
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:23,867
You can't say that.
You don't know.

501
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:27,233
I thought I was gonna
pass out from the pain.

502
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,833
Anyway, I-I tried,

503
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,300
but I couldn't.

504
00:24:30,367 --> 00:24:33,933
I just couldn't bend that way,
so...

505
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,733
- Oh, Monica looks at Joey.
- Eww!

506
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
That's right, I stepped up.

507
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,033
She's my friend
and she needed help.

508
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,500
If I had to,
I'd pee on any one of you.

509
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,167
Only, uh, I couldn't.

510
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,767
I got the stage fright.

511
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,167
I wanted to help,

512
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:59,567
but there was just too much
pressure, so... so I, uh...

513
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,967
I turned to Chandler.

514
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:08,167
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it, do it, do it now."

515
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:11,833
Sometimes late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

516
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,633
That... That's 'cause sometimes
I just do it through the wall

517
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,400
to freak you out.

518
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:17,533
And scene.

519
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
You know, I was laughing
in that scene.

520
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,100
Do you remember
the first table read ever?

521
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,033
That's the first time
I laid eyes on any of you.

522
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,800
I don't remember how...
I remember what you wore.

523
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,367
- That's it.
- That's unbelievable.

524
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:30,967
I don't remember
what the boys wore.

525
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,667
I do remember what Courteney
and you wore.

526
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:34,300
- That's it.
- What did I wear?

527
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,867
- A white lacy hippie-ish blouse.
- Oh, I was trying to be Phoebe.

528
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,433
You were being Phoebe.
And jeans.

529
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,733
And Courteney had
a pink babydoll tee

530
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,533
from Fred Segal
with a white trim.

531
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,233
Yeah, I just remember
that's when we all met

532
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,433
or I remember meeting everyone
the first time.

533
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,867
You don't remember
what I was wearing?

534
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:53,100
I don't remember what,

535
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,100
but I do remember
you're the first person I saw.

536
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,900
And I was like, "Oh, okay.
That's why I've been losing out

537
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,467
on all of these roles
over these years.

538
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,833
I mean, this is the good...
this is the hunk.

539
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,667
You know, right here.
Of course he's Joey."

540
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:08,600
And then hearing all of you
for the first time,

541
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,733
- I... that blew me away.
- That's what I remember.

542
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,167
I just thought everyone
was so perfectly cast.

543
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,800
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's what I remember.

544
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,967
Casting the show
was really hard,

545
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:22,833
much more so than
I think we expected it to be.

546
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,767
We saw approximately
a gazillion people.

547
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,433
There are so many
different scenarios

548
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,433
where it wasn't going to be
these six people.

549
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,133
It would have been
such a different show.

550
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,967
We had seen David
for another role

551
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:40,833
for a pilot
we'd done the year before.

552
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,133
His hangdog expression
stuck with us.

553
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,067
So when we started doing Ross,
that was in our minds.

554
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:51,567
Try to get David.
David has quit television.

555
00:26:51,633 --> 00:26:56,033
He's had a miserable experience
doing another show.

556
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,667
He's moved back to Chicago
to just do theater.

557
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:02,067
And we had to beg him
and beseech him.

558
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,967
And "We wrote this for you."

559
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,433
I believe we sent him
gift baskets.

560
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,833
I have no recollection
of the gift basket.

561
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,633
I thought we just
sent him the script.

562
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,133
We assured him that whatever
his past experience was,

563
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
this was going to be different,
we promise.

564
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,500
And he... he came on board.

565
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:18,967
Alright, we got one.

566
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,567
We saw a bunch of women
who read Phoebe,

567
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:27,433
and it was nothing.

568
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,933
And meanwhile, my husband,
Jeffrey, was writing

569
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,567
and producing on
"Mad About You," and he said,

570
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:37,600
"Phoebe is right here
playing Ursula the waitress."

571
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,200
Here you go.

572
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,267
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks. We're fine.

573
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,567
Okay, I'm just gonna go
get your check, then.

574
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:46,500
- Got it right here.
- Great. Okay. Right.

575
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:50,300
You could see a lot of the
beginnings of Phoebe there,

576
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,600
but on "Mad About You,"
she had more of an edge.

577
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,733
Phoebe was a much more
positive image.

578
00:27:57,233 --> 00:28:01,700
Lisa was someone who came in
and nailed the audition.

579
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:04,500
She not only did
everything we'd hoped,

580
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,500
she elevated the material.

581
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:07,833
Lisa Kudrow was
the second one

582
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,200
to get cast in "Friends"
right after David.

583
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,800
And that was at the beginning,
so we thought we were on a roll.

584
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,667
And then came about
two and a half months

585
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:16,400
where we cast no one.

586
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,167
Matt LeBlanc,
if I remember correctly,

587
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,500
had like $11 in his pocket
when he auditioned.

588
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:29,900
Maybe it was $9,
but it wasn't a lot.

589
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:33,500
We saw a lot of guys
who you believed were actors,

590
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:37,867
guys who liked women,
but they weren't funny.

591
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:43,567
Then Matt came in and suddenly
on him, the lines felt funny.

592
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:44,967
He hadn't done an awful lot.

593
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,600
He'd done another show,
but he hadn't done an awful lot.

594
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,067
So Matt went right down
to the wire,

595
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:53,667
auditioned at the network,
at NBC with another actor,

596
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,500
and he killed it,
and he got the part as Joey.

597
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,667
But the funny thing about it is

598
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,700
the other actor ended up
in the show

599
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:02,200
in "The One With the Unagi,"

600
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:05,333
playing Fake Joey, ironically.

601
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,800
How are you <i>doing?</i>

602
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:10,833
No, no, no, no, no.

603
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,000
How <i>you</i> doin'?

604
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:16,233
How <i>you</i> doin'? Damn it, Carl.

605
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,567
Go wait in the hall.

606
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:26,767
What do you remember
about the audition process?

607
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,600
I remember I had gone in
a bunch of times,

608
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:35,533
and I think it was
on the final callback.

609
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,633
I had gone... I had gone with
a friend of mine to run lines

610
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,933
and he said, you know,

611
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,133
"So the show's about friends
and being friends

612
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,300
with, you know,
just a group of friends?"

613
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,367
I was like, "Yeah, kind of."

614
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:47,333
He goes, "Then we should
go out drinking."

615
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,767
And I was like, "Yeah,
that's a good idea."

616
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,267
So to make a long story short,

617
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,433
I woke up in the middle
of the night at his apartment

618
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,767
and had to go to the bathroom,
and I got up too fast.

619
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,500
And I can't believe
I'm telling this,

620
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:02,933
but I kind of blacked out,
as you do,

621
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,100
and fell face first
into the toilet.

622
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:08,167
And I hit my nose
on the bottom of the toilet seat

623
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:12,600
and a huge, like, chunk of meat
came off my nose.

624
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,067
And I'm looking in the mirror
and it's bleeding.

625
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:15,933
I was like, "Oh, my God."

626
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,433
So I have to go in
for the big callback.

627
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,200
And it's like a big,
ugly scab on my nose.

628
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:24,700
And Marta Kauffman said,
"What happened to your face?"

629
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,867
And I told the truth
and got the job so...

630
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,067
- Look at that.
- Right? That's what happened.

631
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,200
And, David,
I know that at the time,

632
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:42,100
I think you were... you were
doing a lot of theater.

633
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:45,333
What was it about "Friends"
that attracted you to it?

634
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,700
Marta and David made it clear
to me, made it known to me

635
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:53,400
that they had written the role
of Ross with my voice in mind.

636
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:55,167
And I was like,
"Well, I don't understand."

637
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:58,133
- Ah, it's a bug. It's a bug.
- Oh, no!

638
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,100
- Is it gone?
- No, it's right there.

639
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,267
Aah! Oh, that's fuzz.
That's fuzz.

640
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,733
That's alright.

641
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:14,800
Was it real?

642
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:17,100
- Is it gone?
- It's gone, it's gone.

643
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,433
Can I just say...

644
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,467
The important thing is
that we dealt with it well.

645
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,133
Yeah.

646
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,067
You even reacted to that
like Phoebe.

647
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:28,367
That was great.

648
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,567
That was much more
entertaining than my story.

649
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,333
It really was.

650
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:37,900
We were having a tough time
finding Monica,

651
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:41,833
and we really saw Courteney
as kind of a Rachel at the time.

652
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,033
We met with Courteney Cox,
and she explained to us

653
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,167
why she didn't think
she was a Rachel

654
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,800
and that she herself
was more of a Monica.

655
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,167
And she was right.

656
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:57,800
Courteney brought this
incredible joy to the character.

657
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,867
She'd been in
the Bruce Springsteen video

658
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:02,267
and with Michael J. Fox
on "Family Ties."

659
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,467
So people knew Courteney.

660
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:08,167
Not enough so that it made it
the Courteney Cox show,

661
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,300
which was always the fear.

662
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,600
We didn't want stars.

663
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:13,300
But everything
Courteney brought to it

664
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,033
made Monica so much richer

665
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,000
than what we had
originally intended.

666
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,333
I thought Chandler was gonna be
the easiest part to cast,

667
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,633
because he's not
just a character.

668
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,300
He's got jokes. He's got,
like, actual real jokes.

669
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,867
So I thought, "Here we go.
This is gonna be great."

670
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:39,900
And we saw actor after actor,
and it wasn't funny.

671
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,467
We had worked with
Matthew Perry on "Dream On."

672
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:47,200
And when Matthew reads
that dialogue, it sparkles

673
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,567
and it comes alive.

674
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,900
And for the first time
through the casting process,

675
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,733
we knew there was
a character there

676
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,833
and that this was
the only guy to play it.

677
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,533
There was just
a little problem.

678
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,667
He had already signed on
for another sitcom.

679
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:07,167
It was about luggage handlers
in the future at LAX.

680
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:10,433
It just sounded insane.

681
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,533
Enjoy Los Angeles.

682
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,800
By the way, Griffith Park
has the best picnic areas.

683
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:21,233
Thank you.
You are most insignificant.

684
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,900
And then someone from
Warner Bros. actually was

685
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:27,333
at the taping of "2194"

686
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,833
and thought
"This show is never going.

687
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,533
Put him in 'Friends.'
We'll be okay."

688
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
Suddenly it was like
"There's our Chandler."

689
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,900
And I just won $1 million.

690
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,300
He spins the lines in a way
that they're his.

691
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:46,600
And there's so many
comedy skills there.

692
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,767
Rachel was the hardest part
to cast,

693
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,600
and it was
the last part we cast.

694
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,100
She could be a really
unlikable character.

695
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,300
I mean, this is an incredibly
selfish, self-involved,

696
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:05,267
spoiled... in the wrong hands,
you don't like Rachel.

697
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,767
We saw lots and lots
and lots of other women.

698
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:11,733
Women who come in wearing
actual wedding dresses

699
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,267
and none of it...

700
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:15,733
You didn't really fall in love,
and you needed to,

701
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,333
'cause you needed to feel
what Ross was feeling.

702
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,433
And then Jennifer came in.

703
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,833
Jennifer had a similar problem
to Matthew in that

704
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,200
she'd already signed on

705
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:27,267
to a show called
"Muddling Through."

706
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,567
You gonna eat that steak
or argue with it?

707
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:33,600
Madeline, this here steak
was supposed to be rare.

708
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,100
Gidney, tell me something.

709
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,367
How often do we
have steak on the menu?

710
00:34:37,433 --> 00:34:38,533
Shoot, hardly ever.

711
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,033
That's right.

712
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,267
So what you have there
is a rare steak.

713
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,400
And they had already shot
six episodes of this show,

714
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,400
so it was a little bit more
than just the pilot.

715
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:55,367
And we took this big risk
to cast her,

716
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,000
share her with this other show

717
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:58,767
and we'll see who wins.

718
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,267
And we even shot
not only the pilot,

719
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:05,067
but probably three
episodes of "Friends"

720
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,633
while that show
was still on television.

721
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,033
And if it had...
if CBS had picked it up,

722
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,267
we would have had to reshoot

723
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,400
the first three episodes
of "Friends."

724
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:19,300
Jennifer had this warmth
and sincerity

725
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,900
and genuineness about her,
where she just made you feel

726
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:26,333
okay about everything else
that Rachel was

727
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,700
that you might have
passed judgment on.

728
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:31,267
I was kind of hoping
that wouldn't be an issue.

729
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,400
Thank you.

730
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:38,000
Cut. Alright.

731
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,033
So, that's right.

732
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,033
So, Matthew and Jen,
you were in another show.

733
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,633
I mean, Jen, what were
your first impressions

734
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,733
of the rest of the cast

735
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,100
when you finally got
to meet them,

736
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:52,533
when it was made clear
that you could do the show?

737
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Well, first of all, I had
a graveyard of failed pilots.

738
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,000
I did a pilot a year
and I thought,

739
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,233
"That's what you do.

740
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,533
You do a pilot a year
and you have some cash.

741
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,700
And then you go on
to another pilot."

742
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:07,167
And I just remember sitting
with these five other people

743
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,533
and thinking,

744
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,867
"This is the greatest
group of people,

745
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:13,300
the greatest script.

746
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,333
I have to do this."

747
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,700
And I actually,
tail between my legs,

748
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:21,000
hat in hand, went to the
producer of the show I was on

749
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,400
because they hired me
in second position,

750
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:28,067
and I said, "Please release me
from this show.

751
00:36:28,133 --> 00:36:30,233
I love this show
that I'm doing right now.

752
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,933
Nothing against your show.

753
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,800
I just love these people
and I am having so much fun."

754
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:39,933
And he said... he goes,
"I-I saw that show.

755
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,367
I'm gonna tell you something.

756
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,300
That show's not gonna
make you a star."

757
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,833
"This show is gonna
make you a star."

758
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,567
- Enough said.
- Well, he's here tonight.

759
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:52,733
- That producer's here tonight.
- No!

760
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,133
Okay, guys, you're up.

761
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,733
Okay, It's All Relative.

762
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:09,733
"While in Las Vegas,

763
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,600
Joey finds
his identical hand twin."

764
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:17,000
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see these identical hands

765
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:21,433
showcased in some type
of a, uh, entertainment venue?

766
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,700
If you leave now,
I will chop off my hand

767
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,467
and give it to you.

768
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:30,533
From this lineup...

769
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,733
please identify
Joey's hand twin.

770
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,267
2 or 3.

771
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,200
- I think it's 2.
- You think it's 2?

772
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,467
I think it's 2.

773
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,033
Right there, number 2.

774
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,633
Yes, that is correct.

775
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:56,567
It's Thomas Lennon, everybody.

776
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,133
Great seeing you guys.
Great seeing you.

777
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,500
Great to see you.

778
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:03,100
Alright.

779
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,733
Alright, ladies, ladies,
you're up.

780
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,400
- Fears. Fears and Pet Peeves.
- Fears and Pet Peeves.

781
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,967
- Fears and Pet Peeves.
- Louder, Court.

782
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,167
"Ladies, there's a message
on the answering machine.

783
00:38:14,233 --> 00:38:17,300
Can you identify the voice?"

784
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:20,800
Matt, can you hit that button?

785
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:24,367
"Hey, guys, I'm finally
retiring from ophthalmology

786
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:26,167
and would love for all of you

787
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:28,867
to come to my retirement party
next week."

788
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,267
- Tom... Oh, sorry.
- Let me know if you can make it.

789
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,733
- Tom Selleck.
- Tom Selleck.

790
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,667
Oh, my God.
I didn't say that. Wait.

791
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:37,200
- You looked so disappointed.
- Well, it's okay.

792
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,833
Will the mystery voice
please make himself known?

793
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,733
How could it not be?

794
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,800
Look who it is.

795
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Tom Selleck, everybody.

796
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,067
Hello.

797
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,833
Do you want to sit for a sec?

798
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,567
- How you doing?
- Good to see you, buddy.

799
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,533
- Wow.
- Wow.

800
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,333
Alright, Tom,
you have a bonus question.

801
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,833
- Alright.
- Oh, God. Okay.

802
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,033
Monica famously chose Chandler
over Richard.

803
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,133
What did Chandler
do for a living?

804
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,133
Oh, my God.

805
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,133
Just think this through.
Think it through.

806
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,300
I say transponster.

807
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,367
No, that's what
we lost the apartment over.

808
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,267
Oh, I thought we never
found out, though.

809
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,800
- Transponster sounds good to me.
- Yes.

810
00:39:31,867 --> 00:39:33,300
Transponster's not right.

811
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:34,733
That's what I said.
That's not even a word.

812
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,000
And then we lost.

813
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,767
Right. Here's the answer.
And it's...

814
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,533
- Oh, Tom has it.
- Yeah.

815
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,533
Nobody knows, really.

816
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,367
- That's the answer.
- That's what I just said.

817
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,967
Hey, that's the answer.

818
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:46,633
Yeah, that is the answer.

819
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,500
I think that should
go to the girls, then.

820
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:50,400
- I do too.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,733
They didn't have... No, no, no.

822
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,633
Yeah, yeah,
we said nobody knows.

823
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,667
And the girls are the winners.

824
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,367
Obviously, the show came out

825
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,700
and immediately resonated
with people.

826
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,000
When did you start to feel like
those changes

827
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:15,133
that you'd been told about
were starting...

828
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,733
the world
was starting to change?

829
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,833
- The summer.
- It was... Yeah.

830
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,867
When we came back
for a second season,

831
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:21,833
it was a completely
different ballgame.

832
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,700
I think people were starting
to say, "Hey,"

833
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:27,867
and you were not...
you were scared.

834
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:31,233
And "What do you want?"
And at first, it's very jarring.

835
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,033
No one really prepares you for
what that's going to be like.

836
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,667
I remember one time I was...
It was middle of the week,

837
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:40,467
I guess it was, I don't remember
what day of the week.

838
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:41,600
Doesn't matter.

839
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:43,000
It goes Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday.

840
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:45,400
Yeah, that part I know.
But it was... I was...

841
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:48,133
I happened to have the news on,
and on the TV,

842
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,467
they had the screen split
into six boxes.

843
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:55,233
And it was an aerial shot,
live, of each of our houses.

844
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,533
Oh, geez.

845
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,267
And I remember looking at it
going "What the ..."

846
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,833
and I could hear the helicopter
over my house.

847
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,267
I was like, "What the hell?"

848
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:08,000
And I'm looking close at the
screen, and my roof is a mess.

849
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:10,767
So when the helicopter
flew away,

850
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,800
I got the ladder out
and went up on the roof

851
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:15,700
and sure as shit, I've got
some leaks up there.

852
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,767
I had to call the roofer and
have them come over and fix it.

853
00:41:18,833 --> 00:41:22,900
The fact is,
like, no one was going through

854
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:25,933
what we were going through
except the other five.

855
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,100
So I think that was really...

856
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,000
So there's no shoulders
outside of this group

857
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:30,800
to sort of go,
"Oh, this is so ..."

858
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:33,000
And I think
it kind of created...

859
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:34,867
imprinted in
our neural pathways

860
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:37,367
this sort of, like,
we are actually family.

861
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,233
Yeah. Because our family
couldn't relate.

862
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,467
Our friends, our closest friends
couldn't relate.

863
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,233
- They were there for us, I think.
- Your family could...

864
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,533
My family was more starstruck
about it than we were.

865
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,867
But the only other people who
really knew what it was like

866
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:51,367
were the other five.

867
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,867
It seemed like
you weren't getting...

868
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:55,467
We were doing a show,
and we were working really hard.

869
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:59,933
But it wasn't until I was
walking through the airport...

870
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,367
I don't remember
where I was going...

871
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,733
but they were on every magazine.

872
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,967
And I was like, "Whoa.
Holy shit. This is crazy."

873
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,333
The theme song became a hit
on a radio station.

874
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,467
And when I heard that
on my car one day,

875
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:23,300
that was like, "Wow, this is not
your average television show."

876
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,433
They're on the cover
of <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

877
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,800
<i>Rolling Stone.</i>
I mean, we're a TV show.

878
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,567
They've somehow entered
the zeitgeist.

879
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:32,800
I don't know when that happened.

880
00:42:32,867 --> 00:42:34,300
♪ I'll be there for you ♪

881
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,367
Jennifer is gorgeous.
Why is it such a phenomenon?

882
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:40,767
It just suits her very well.
It's spectacular.

883
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,667
I think my favorite was
I was dropping my kids off,

884
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:47,033
and my rabbi stopped me and
asked me about Ross and Rachel

885
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,500
and when they were gonna
get together

886
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,533
and how that's gonna happen.

887
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,800
Wherever we were,

888
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:55,467
suddenly there are
thousands of people gathered.

889
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:56,800
It's like the Beatles
were there.

890
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,067
Everybody was screaming

891
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,333
and yelling
and behind barricades.

892
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,500
- It was crazy.
- Bye!

893
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:03,267
Once "Friends" had gone global,

894
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:06,667
I think we were in
18 different languages.

895
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,700
Basically any place I went,

896
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:22,200
you know, from Jordan to India,
they knew what "Friends" was.

897
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,000
My mom bought me the DVDs
of the whole series

898
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:26,433
when I was in elementary school.

899
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,067
"Friends" really had a big hand
in teaching me English,

900
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:31,333
and the show
really taught me the things

901
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,533
about life and true friendship.

902
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,533
We love "Friends."

903
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,433
Ohh.

904
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,333
Could I be wearing
any more clothes?

905
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,267
My eyes! My eyes!

906
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,533
Pervert! Pervert!

907
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,233
Shut up! Shut up!

908
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,800
♪ Smelly cat, smelly cat ♪

909
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:53,567
♪ What are they feeding you? ♪

910
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:55,200
Excuse me. Excuse me.

911
00:43:55,267 --> 00:43:57,300
Yeah, noisy boys.

912
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,767
We became fans of "Friends"

913
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:01,633
when we were in first year
in college.

914
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,167
We were too shy
to talk to girls,

915
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:06,867
so "Friends" was a way
to boost our morale

916
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,167
and boost our confidence

917
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:10,867
and be able to make new friends,
especially ladies.

918
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:12,767
Yeah, baby.

919
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:17,033
My most favorite episode
on "Friends" is the episode

920
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,567
in which Monica asks Chandler
to marry her.

921
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:20,933
After seeing that,

922
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,500
I knew that is the way
I wanted to ask my soul mate

923
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,100
and my husband to marry me,
and that's exactly what I did.

924
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,333
I'm a single mom,
and, you know, society pushes us

925
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,200
to marry the first guy who does
say, "Will you marry me?"

926
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:37,467
But I mean, as a woman, you have
to take control of your life.

927
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:40,000
So watching that episode
got me thinking

928
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:44,867
that I can also take charge
of my own relationship.

929
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:45,967
We're engaged!

930
00:44:59,067 --> 00:45:00,667
I was battling depression.

931
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,667
I was at a very dark place.

932
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,833
One week, I wouldn't go out.

933
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,033
The need to even eat
was a problem.

934
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
I wouldn't eat.

935
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:25,700
I was a gay man who wanted to
have hair like Jennifer Aniston.

936
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:30,367
So you can imagine how lonely
I sometimes felt.

937
00:45:30,433 --> 00:45:33,433
And "Friends" was
what I came home to.

938
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,200
"Friends" was...

939
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:40,500
They were my friends
since I didn't really have any.

940
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:45,400
And, um... I can't.

941
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:48,400
It became a reason
for me to wake up every day

942
00:45:48,467 --> 00:45:51,233
because I felt
I had friends around me.

943
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:00,433
Like every Chandler,

944
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,000
I found my Monica.

945
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:05,733
I'm gonna cry.

946
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,633
That's so nice.

947
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,467
They have no idea

948
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,900
the kind of impact they
partially made in this world,

949
00:46:12,967 --> 00:46:14,767
so when they sleep,
they should relax

950
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,067
knowing that
they have saved more lives,

951
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,433
even if they don't know them.
I am one.

952
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,100
And for those who don't like
the show, just, uh...

953
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,933
I think you're like Joey 100%,

954
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,700
because you just walk
into my room

955
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:32,000
with these jokes
that don't make sense.

956
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,400
- They are funny.
- But you are howling.

957
00:46:33,467 --> 00:46:34,500
Like, you have tears
coming out of your eyes.

958
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:35,700
They're always funny.

959
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:36,833
So, yeah, I think you're Joey

960
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,267
with a hint of Phoebe.

961
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,933
Vee loves "Friends."

962
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,700
And I realize what, like,
this true addiction

963
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,500
to a TV show means.

964
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:51,833
- We watched it together as well.
- And then I got you hooked.

965
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,933
Yes, and that was
my proudest moment.

966
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,800
When I got her hooked on it,
I was like,

967
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,167
"Mission accomplished."

968
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,167
And then we'd stay up all night
watching it together.

969
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,500
You know, "Friends"
brought friends together.

970
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,167
Okay, everyone, gather up.

971
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:07,000
One of my favorite moments
from "Friends" is the routine,

972
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:09,400
and that's the show
where Ross and Monica

973
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,667
want to perform
their favorite dance.

974
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:13,900
I know what'll get us up
on a platform.

975
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:16,900
- What?
- The routine.

976
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,267
The routine.

977
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:20,533

Now, throughout tonight,

994
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,667
we're gonna take questions
from the audience.

995
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:10,500
There's a lot of fans here.

996
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:13,667
Has anybody got a question
tonight

997
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:15,100
for the cast of "Friends"?

998
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:16,833
Yes, there's a lady right here.

999
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,833
Yes. What's your question?

1000
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,200
So, "Friends" was obviously
amazing for all of you,

1001
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,767
but was there anything
that you didn't like?

1002
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,667
Way to keep it positive.

1003
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:30,867
Was there anything
that you didn't like

1004
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:32,467
while you were shooting
the show?

1005
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:33,767
- The monkey.
- And the monkey.

1006
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,933
- Oh, the monkey.
- Not Marcel. Really?

1007
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,167
- The monkey scared me.
- I loved the monkey.

1008
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,367
David was not a fan.

1009
00:48:40,433 --> 00:48:41,567
Yeah, 'cause you didn't
have to touch it.

1010
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:43,833
- What? I did too.
- Yeah, she did. She did.

1011
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:48,500
Eh. See...

1012
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,967
First of all, I want to say
I love animals.

1013
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:52,967
I love primates.

1014
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,733
I have nothing against animals.

1015
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,100
I'm an animal lover.

1016
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:59,167
However, I'm...

1017
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:00,467
Here was my problem.

1018
00:49:00,533 --> 00:49:02,833
Like, the monkey,

1019
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,367
obviously, it was trained
and it had to hit its mark

1020
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:10,967
and do its thing right at the,
you know, at the perfect time.

1021
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:13,333
But what inevitably
began to happen

1022
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,067
was we would
all have choreographed,

1023
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:19,900
like, bits kind of timed out,
and it would get messed up

1024
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:22,633
because the monkey
didn't do its job right.

1025
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,233
So we'd have to... we'd have
to... we'd have to reset.

1026
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,100
We'd have to go again
because the monkey

1027
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,333
- didn't get it right.
- David's so angry still.

1028
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,867
So this kept happening
over and over

1029
00:49:32,933 --> 00:49:35,333
where we're about to do
something really funny.

1030
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,733
But the monkey
didn't hit its mark,

1031
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,233
so we have to start again.

1032
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,367
I would like you to be
more serious about this.

1033
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,967
That combined... See, you
didn't have to deal with it.

1034
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:49,033
And that combined with
when the monkey was resting

1035
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,333
and just waiting for,
you know, for us to roll,

1036
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,467
it would sit on my shoulder
and the trainer would come up

1037
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:59,800
and just open and give... give
the monkey live grubs to eat.

1038
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:03,300
So the monkey... the monkey
would be sitting on my shoulder,

1039
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,733
take some grubs...
take some grubs,

1040
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,267
like, break them in half,
these squirming, live...

1041
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:11,433
then eat it, and then he'd just
go like that.

1042
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,133
So I'd have monkey grubby hands
all over, all over.

1043
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,133
And it just wasn't... it was...
it was time for Marcel to...

1044
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:24,667
...to off, you know?

1045
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,533
I got to say, great question.

1046
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,467
You really threw up
some good answers there.

1047
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,900
Alright. Okay. Let's go...

1048
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,133
I think
we've got another question.

1049
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,000
Yes. There's a couple here
in the audience here.

1050
00:50:39,067 --> 00:50:40,833
Do you have a question?

1051
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,600
Yes, I do.

1052
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:48,467
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's Mr. and Mrs. Geller.

1053
00:50:48,533 --> 00:50:52,467
Christina Pickles
and Elliott Gould, everybody.

1054
00:50:52,533 --> 00:50:54,600
Yay!

1055
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,833
Eliot, Christina,
I'm keen to know,

1056
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,800
what do you remember
about that time?

1057
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:01,467
I remember they were
awfully nice to us.

1058
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:03,933
Very down-to-earth,
real people.

1059
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,033
We loved it
because they loved us.

1060
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,400
And one day we came to work
and they said,

1061
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:11,867
"The parents are here,
the parents are here."

1062
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,667
And it was so moving.

1063
00:51:13,733 --> 00:51:15,867
And we really did feel
like their parents.

1064
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:19,233
In fact, we used to worry
about them quite a lot.

1065
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,633
And Elliott said to me,

1066
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,867
"We're behaving like
we're really their parents,"

1067
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:26,533
and we really did feel we were
because they're so sweet.

1068
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,133
- We love you.
- That's incredibly sweet.

1069
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,400
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

1070
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,800
Fantastic.

1071
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,833
I'd have to say,
I'm most like Monica

1072
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,333
because I'm a clean freak.

1073
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,667
You know, I travel a lot

1074
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:51,367
and I'm always in hotels.

1075
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,033
I've always got downtime.

1076
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,967
When I'm missing the kids,
when I'm missing the family,

1077
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:57,533
I put on "Friends"
because it makes me smile.

1078
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,267
Orange juice
and what looks like cider.

1079
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,733
My favorite episode has to be

1080
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,467
where they're all getting ready
in the apartment.

1081
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:09,033
It's fat. I drank fat.

1082
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,500
Ross is hurrying everyone up

1083
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:14,433
because he has a huge speech
to make, and he's nervous.

1084
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,700
- Why aren't you guys dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

1085
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,400
When Chandler
goes to the toilet,

1086
00:52:18,467 --> 00:52:20,533
Joey sits in Chandler's chair,

1087
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,800
and then he comes back
and it all escalates.

1088
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:25,500
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

1089
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:29,000
- Because I was sitting there.
- But then you left.

1090
00:52:29,067 --> 00:52:31,667
Well, it's not like
I went to Spain.

1091
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:34,100
Joey eventually
gives up his seat,

1092
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,633
but he takes the cushions
with him.

1093
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,833
What are you doing?

1094
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,267
Well, you said I had
to give you the chair.

1095
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,600
You didn't say anything
about the cushions.

1096
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:42,533
The cushions are the essence
of the chair.

1097
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,967
That's right.
I'm taking the essence.

1098
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:48,233
It's one of those episodes
that when I'm away

1099
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,700
and when I'm feeling
a little bit low,

1100
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,067
I just put it on

1101
00:52:51,133 --> 00:52:54,067
and it makes me smile
to almost the point of crying.

1102
00:52:58,933 --> 00:53:03,233
You hide my clothes,
I'm wearing everything you own.

1103
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,800
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me, I'm Chandler.

1104
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:11,233
Could I be wearing
any more clothes?

1105
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,900
Maybe if I wasn't
going commando.

1106
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,567
"The One Where Nobody's Ready,"
it's the first episode

1107
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:20,467
we ever did that's shot
in real time like a play.

1108
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,933
I'll tell you, it's hot
with all this stuff on.

1109
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,800
I better not do any,
I don't know, lunges.

1110
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:30,000
Some of that was you had
to do some bottle shows.

1111
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,933
You had to do shows that weren't
gonna cost a fortune

1112
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,733
and keep them located
just on our sets

1113
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,533
without building new sets,
without, you know.

1114
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,467
So how do you make a story where
you put everybody in one room?

1115
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:43,733
What were you doing when
your arm came out of the socket?

1116
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,133
- Oh.
- Shoulder.

1117
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,500
That was when he and I
were fighting over the chair.

1118
00:53:47,567 --> 00:53:49,600
That was one of
the best episodes we ever did.

1119
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,133
- Oh, oh, I remember.
- Okay, you tell it.

1120
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,667
- Firemen.
- Yeah.

1121
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:56,367
There were firemen
in the episode.

1122
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:58,100
- No.
- No? I'm sorry.

1123
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,467
There were firemen on the set.

1124
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,267
No, Warner Bros.
fire department

1125
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:02,500
came in to help Joey.

1126
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:04,033
I'm sorry. I take it back.

1127
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:08,167
But go ahead
and announce that again.

1128
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:11,800
That's the best moment
I've had in months.

1129
00:54:11,867 --> 00:54:14,667
Chandler and Joey have been
fighting over this chair,

1130
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:18,100
and Joey runs
and jumps into the chair.

1131
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:26,133
We shot it three times,
and it went perfectly.

1132
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,600
Lord knows why we had
to shoot it a fourth time.

1133
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:33,067
You want to go for me
sitting on Matty's lap?

1134
00:54:33,133 --> 00:54:35,433
And I went just to jump
over the coffee table

1135
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,167
- and somehow tripped.
- Oh, God.

1136
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,533
And my legs
went up in the air

1137
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,067
and my shoulder
came out of the socket.

1138
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,400
Are we gonna watch this?
His arm getting pulled out?

1139
00:54:46,467 --> 00:54:48,067
- Oh, here it is.
- Oh, shit.

1140
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:50,233
I don't want to see pain.

1141
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,467
It doesn't look like anything
till I stand up.

1142
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:53,867
Okay, okay.

1143
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,433
Action.

1144
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,133
Oh, no!

1145
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,233
Ow, ow, ow.
It happened right there?

1146
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,667
- Yeah.
- Did it already happen?

1147
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:05,767
- Yeah.
- Shit.

1148
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:06,800
Ohh.

1149
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:16,567
Oh, are you pulling on it?
Are you pulling the wrong arm?

1150
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:20,733
- No, it's the other one.
- It's the other one.

1151
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,600
No, no, no, no,
it's going down too far.

1152
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:24,667
Oh, shit.

1153
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:33,767
Okay, Gretchen?
Just a moment, please.

1154
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:36,233
- Should we cut?
- Ow!

1155
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,067
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

1156
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,567
- Are you for real?
- Yeah.

1157
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,100
- Yeah, 'cause he dislocated his shoulder.
- 'Cause it hurt.

1158
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:42,667
Oh, I thought someone tried
to pull on it.

1159
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,567
Jesus.

1160
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,133
Cut.

1161
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,233
So in come all the paramedics
and whatever,

1162
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,733
and they've got to take him
to the hospital.

1163
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,967
And so that was the end
of filming

1164
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:57,333
because it wasn't
even an episode

1165
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,033
we're like, "Well, we can
shoot out the other scenes."

1166
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,567
No, it happened to be
on the one episode

1167
00:56:01,633 --> 00:56:03,000
where it's just the six of them,

1168
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:06,433
they're all in it,
and we're done for the night.

1169
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,700
And the way...
do you remember how

1170
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:10,067
the sling was written
into the show?

1171
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,167
- No.
- Oh.

1172
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,233
Whoa!

1173
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:20,467
See, Joe,
that's why your parents told you

1174
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:22,600
not to jump on the bed.

1175
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,933
So we had to put that
into the show,

1176
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,367
but we waited
until he was okay again

1177
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:32,133
to film the ending of "The One
Where No One Was Ready."

1178
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,467
Did you tell the doctor
you did it

1179
00:56:33,533 --> 00:56:36,400
- jumping up and down on your bed?
- No.

1180
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:40,833
So what started out to be
the simplest "Friends" episode

1181
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,767
ended up taking the longest
amount of time to shoot.

1182
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,200
There was one thing
that we did every show

1183
00:56:47,267 --> 00:56:49,433
that we didn't do that night
before we started.

1184
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,800
- Our huddle.
- Mm-hmm.

1185
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:52,633
- We didn't do it that night.
- We didn't do the huddle.

1186
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,733
We didn't do it?

1187
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,200
That's the one time
we didn't do it.

1188
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:57,033
- Why didn't we do it?
- I don't know.

1189
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,867
That's right, 'cause we were
sort of like,

1190
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,767
"You know what?
We're taking too long.

1191
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,400
The audience has been waiting.
Let's just go."

1192
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:04,833
I think that's why
we didn't do it.

1193
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,433
- Really?
- Well, it was sort of early on.

1194
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,767
- It wasn't like...
- It was very early on.

1195
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:10,033
And then after that,

1196
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,667
we were like,
"Do we need to do the huddle?"

1197
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,033
- And he'd say, "Yeah."
- Yeah, we do.

1198
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,933
"'Cause I don't want anything
else falling off me."

1199
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,567
- Yeah.
- We do need to do the huddle.

1200
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:19,467
After that, we always did it.

1201
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:20,767
Let's go see where
we did the huddle.

1202
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:22,133
Right here. Let's go.

1203
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,033
Straight down
to this purple door.

1204
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,800
We did the huddle right here.

1205
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:26,900
- Yeah.
- Right around here.

1206
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:28,167
Come on, let's do a huddle.
Come on.

1207
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:30,100
Wait. You mean we...

1208
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:38,133
So the atmosphere on tape night
was always crackling.

1209
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,033
There was a lot of energy.

1210
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:45,567
It was exciting.
You're putting on a show.

1211
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:50,800
It was a fun night,

1212
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,767
but it was a really hard
working night for us

1213
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,233
and we would listen
to the audience.

1214
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,733
And if a joke didn't land,
even if we loved that joke,

1215
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,967
they were telling us
it's not good enough.

1216
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:05,333
So we would put our heads
together and try to beat it.

1217
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,233
It's a buffet.
It's in trouble.

1218
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,467
It's in trouble,
like I'm gonna go eat it all.

1219
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:12,733
How about "Here's where I win
all my money back"?

1220
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,300
I like that. Great.

1221
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,067
Kevin, there's a lot
of changes coming.

1222
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,400
- Good shit.
- You guys ready?

1223
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,933
Where is the waitress?
I'm starving.

1224
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,567
It's a buffet, man.

1225
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:32,600
Oh, here's where I win
all my money back.

1226
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:35,200
I really enjoyed the energy
of the audience, though.

1227
00:58:35,267 --> 00:58:36,600
- I mean, the live audience.
- Oh, yeah.

1228
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,033
- I mean...
- I did, too.

1229
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,633
It's like doing a one-act play
every week with all of us.

1230
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,733
I found myself, like,

1231
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,233
when they would laugh
at something,

1232
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,500
I would think to myself,
"Oh, if you think that's funny,

1233
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,800
when till you get a load
of this next line."

1234
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:49,900
They would challenge me
to try even...

1235
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:52,600
I felt this rewarding feeling.

1236
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:54,267
- Or not. Or a flat nothing.
- I'm coming over here.

1237
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,367
- I feel left out over there.
- Sit here.

1238
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,033
At least to me,

1239
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,000
I felt like I was gonna die
if they didn't laugh.

1240
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:04,200
And it's not healthy for sure.

1241
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:05,867
But I would sometimes
say a line,

1242
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:08,167
and they wouldn't laugh,
and I would sweat

1243
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:12,233
and... and just, like,
go into convulsions.

1244
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,300
If I didn't get the laugh
I was supposed to get,

1245
00:59:14,367 --> 00:59:15,833
- I would freak out.
- It would take you down.

1246
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,033
- You didn't tell us that.
- No?

1247
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,200
No, I don't remember you
ever saying that.

1248
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,800
Oh, yeah, I felt like that
every single night.

1249
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,700
One of the times we listened
to the audience the most

1250
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,367
was when we were
shooting in London

1251
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:34,933
and Monica and Chandler
are in bed together.

1252
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,267
Action.

1253
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,900
I'm getting married today!

1254
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:40,933
Morning, Ross.

1255
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,333
I'm getting married!

1256
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,900
- A-whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

1257
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:47,833
Do you think
he knew I was here?

1258
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,500
The audience went insane.

1259
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,767
We were just standing there
going "This is insane."

1260
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:03,967
We just let them go.

1261
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,300
Okay, your turn.

1262
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:17,833
No, I'm kidding.

1263
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,233
- Cut!
- He told me to say it.

1264
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,367
He did.

1265
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:23,633
I think that moment
was the beginning

1266
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,600
of how we rethought
Monica and Chandler,

1267
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,400
'cause the original plan was

1268
01:00:27,467 --> 01:00:29,167
they would sleep together
in London,

1269
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,167
it was a brief thing,

1270
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:32,800
and we'd have some fun
with it afterward

1271
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:34,800
as they're both like,
"Oh, my God, what did we do?"

1272
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:37,433
But the way
the audience reacted,

1273
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,933
we realized there's more to this

1274
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,867
and we need to pay attention.

1275
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:45,367
Well, I've never done that
with you before.

1276
01:00:50,867 --> 01:00:52,733
That was the end
of the season,

1277
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,700
so we had time to really
ruminate and think about it,

1278
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:58,467
but it was
such a powerful moment

1279
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:01,500
that we knew
we had to explore it more.

1280
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,867
We expanded it from just
a "one night in London" thing

1281
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:07,933
to "this could be a thing"
thing.

1282
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:16,067
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?

1283
01:01:16,133 --> 01:01:18,200
- Oh, that counts.
- Oh, good.

1284
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:20,433
We still, at that point,

1285
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,367
didn't quite realize
how far it would go.

1286
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:25,467
We still thought maybe it'd be
fun with them doing it in secret

1287
01:01:25,533 --> 01:01:28,967
and hiding it, which did give us
a lot of funny stuff.

1288
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:32,200
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

1289
01:01:39,267 --> 01:01:42,600
I've had a very long, hard day.

1290
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,633
I love the episode where
they've just returned home

1291
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,100
from London
and Monica and Chandler

1292
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:48,700
are trying to keep it a secret
that they've been hooking up.

1293
01:01:56,533 --> 01:01:58,600
So thanks for having me over.

1294
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:01,233
The cast,
they know how powerful

1295
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,833
just, like, a funny visual
set piece will be,

1296
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,467
and it's funnier than anything
they could have ever said.

1297
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:09,667
Rach.

1298
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:16,933
Phoebs.

1299
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:24,800
See ya.

1300
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,100
So the really great thing
about "Friends"

1301
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:28,933
- is they're so good with farce.
- What the hell was that?

1302
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,933
So when there's a secret like
Monica and Chandler are dating,

1303
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,367
it's so fun
because we the audience knows,

1304
01:02:34,433 --> 01:02:36,100
but none of the rest
of the cast knows.

1305
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:39,000
Okay, this is from "The One
Where Everyone Finds Out."

1306
01:02:39,067 --> 01:02:40,800
Ugly naked guy's apartment.

1307
01:02:40,867 --> 01:02:43,133
Phoebe and Rachel have
tagged along with Ross.

1308
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,000
Although it's pretty empty,
it's a great place.

1309
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:47,700
Oh, my God.

1310
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,433
I love this apartment.
Isn't it perfect?

1311
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,000
I can't believe I never
realized how... how great it is.

1312
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:55,800
Well, that is because
your eye immediately

1313
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:58,667
- goes to the big naked man.
- It's amazing.

1314
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,600
You better hurry up
and fill out an application,

1315
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:02,000
or I'm gonna beat you to it.

1316
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:03,800
Ohh.

1317
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,533
- That's sort of how you did it.
- Is that?

1318
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,100
Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

1319
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:13,933
but, um, I'm gonna go use
ugly naked guy's bathroom.

1320
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,600
She exits.
Phoebe looks out the window.

1321
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,367
Oh, look,
there's Monica and Chandler.

1322
01:03:18,433 --> 01:03:21,567
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

1323
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:23,833
Chandler and Monica
are standing close together.

1324
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,033
They start taking off
each other's clothes.

1325
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,667
Phoebe's mind is totally blown.

1326
01:03:27,733 --> 01:03:31,400
Oh! Oh!

1327
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:34,000
Oh! Oh!

1328
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:37,467
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!

1329
01:03:37,533 --> 01:03:38,900
Rachel sees
what Phoebe is seeing.

1330
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:40,600
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1331
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:42,967
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1332
01:03:43,033 --> 01:03:44,900
- Oh! My eyes! My eyes!
- I know.

1333
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:47,233
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe,
Phoebs, Phoebe.

1334
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:48,800
- Oh!
- It's okay. It's okay.

1335
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,700
- It's okay.
- They're doing it!

1336
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:52,467
I know. I know.
I actually know.

1337
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:54,533
- I know I know.
- You know?

1338
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,867
I do. I know. And Joey knows.

1339
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,067
But Ross doesn't know.
So you have to stop screaming.

1340
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:03,133
What's going on?

1341
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,167
- What, what?
- Nothing.

1342
01:04:05,233 --> 01:04:06,733
Oh, God, we're just so excited

1343
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,067
that you might
get this apartment.

1344
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:10,400
Actually,
it looks really good.

1345
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:15,800
Get in here. Come on.
Get in here. Hug it out.

1346
01:04:15,867 --> 01:04:17,133
Hug it out. Hug it out.

1347
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,433
Oh, my God.
Alright.

1348
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:37,300
Yeah, don't get too excited.

1349
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:39,067
I haven't done this
in a long time.

1350
01:04:39,133 --> 01:04:42,600
So I should be Phoebe for this.

1351
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:44,667

It's so weird, 'cause
I was walking down the street

01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,967
- and I just happen to have my...
- Guitar.

1363

- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:32,733
- You need some help?
- Yeah, I mean, I think so.

1365
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,500
I love "Smelly Cat."
It's one of my favorite songs.

1366
01:05:36,567 --> 01:05:38,233
- Oh, my God.
- You mind if I...

1367
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,267
- Oh, please.
- ...take "Smelly Cat"

1368
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:41,400
for a spin?

1369
01:05:41,467 --> 01:05:44,967
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Alright.

No, but thank you. Thank you.

1400
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:29,233
This was so great.

1401
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,833
I still think it's better
when it's just me.

1402
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,567
It is.

1403
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,333
Oh, you heard it.

1404
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,733
Can I just say something?

1405
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,400
Thank you so much
for being the person

1406
01:07:40,467 --> 01:07:41,867
for all of us on "Friends"

1407
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:44,433
that was the... I don't know if
this is the right way to say it,

1408
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,233
but the different one or the one
that was really herself.

1409
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,200
Thank you. And thanks for
carrying it along.

1410
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:54,267
- I'm gonna start crying.
- Yeah.

1411
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,067
There are seasons
I've never seen.

1412
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:03,700
- Me too.
- Really?

1413
01:08:03,767 --> 01:08:05,700
- Yeah.
- I've seen them all.

1414
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:06,867
I've seen every episode.

1415
01:08:06,933 --> 01:08:08,067
I would imagine
I've seen them all.

1416
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:10,733
Michel and I started watching
some of Season 4,

1417
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,233
which I thought I had watched.

1418
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:13,733
It's as if I didn't.

1419
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,100
Do you enjoy them
when you watch them?

1420
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:18,167
He enjoys them more than I do

1421
01:08:18,233 --> 01:08:20,333
'cause I'm mortified
with myself.

1422
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:21,900
- Why?
- I don't know.

1423
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:23,567
- You're so good.
- I don't know.

1424
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:30,200
Like Lisa, I hadn't seen it
really in 17 years

1425
01:08:30,267 --> 01:08:33,800
until my daughter just started
watching it this past year.

1426
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:36,100
And that kind of
sucked me into it.

1427
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:39,633
For me when I watch it,
it's... I'm...

1428
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,033
it's hard to watch myself,

1429
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,333
but I feel that way
about anything I do

1430
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:48,800
because I don't believe
the acting that I'm doing,

1431
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:50,600
because I know it's not true,

1432
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:53,933
'cause it was me doing it.

1433
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,800
That's what you do
for a living.

1434
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:57,833
No, I know, but it's weird
to look at myself.

1435
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,600
I'm like,
"I don't buy a word of it."

1436
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,667
It's really weird.

1437
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:07,000
But to watch you guys, I was
just so proud to be on the show.

1438
01:09:07,067 --> 01:09:09,800
It's just some of the stuff
is so great.

1439
01:09:09,867 --> 01:09:12,167
Yeah.
When I do watch the episodes,

1440
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,400
I'm laughing out loud
once in every scene

1441
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:17,233
because you all make me
laugh so hard.

1442
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,600
That thing
with the leather pants.

1443
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,733
Oh, my God. That's still...
That was on the other day.

1444
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,833
I just happened to be
in the kitchen with Maureen

1445
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,867
and we were eating dinner
and "Friends" is on.

1446
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:28,467
And I'm like, "Oh, look at that.
Let's see which one it is."

1447
01:09:28,533 --> 01:09:30,633
And it happened to be the one
with the leather pants.

1448
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,000
And I said to my daughter,
"Watch this.

1449
01:09:34,067 --> 01:09:36,567
This is funny. Watch David."

1450
01:09:36,633 --> 01:09:38,967
And it was really,
really, really funny.

1451
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:41,800
Every little thing,
like pulling the pants up

1452
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:46,267
and, like, slipping and smacking
yourself in the head.

1453
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:48,700
And I know you.
It was all so calculated.

1454
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:50,233
Nothing happens
by accident with you.

1455
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,567
I've watched you put things
together and it was brilliant.

1456
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,467
I can't quite
be specific about which one,

1457
01:10:10,533 --> 01:10:12,767
but I know I'm part
of the Geller family.

1458
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:16,533
I'm incredibly anal,
I'm neurotic as hell,

1459
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,600
and I wear
overly tight trousers.

1460
01:10:22,933 --> 01:10:24,667
Whoa.

1461
01:10:24,733 --> 01:10:27,533
I think one of the reasons
"Friends" is so funny

1462
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,600
is the fact that
these six actors

1463
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,067
are masters of physical comedy.

1464
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,900
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

1465
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:35,767
There's a scene
with David Schwimmer

1466
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:38,533
where Ross has decided
not to pay for

1467
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,667
the delivery service of a sofa,

1468
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:43,167
and they start taking the couch
up the stairs

1469
01:10:43,233 --> 01:10:45,333
and quite quickly,
everyone gets into trouble.

1470
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,133
This is not something that's
gonna go up the stairs.

1471
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,867
Turn.

1472
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,367
I don't think we can turn
anymore.

1473
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:54,800
And David Schwimmer
starts telling them to pivot.

1474
01:10:54,867 --> 01:10:57,400
Here we go, pivot.

1475
01:10:57,467 --> 01:11:00,200
Pivot.

1476
01:11:00,267 --> 01:11:02,133
Pivot!

1477
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,100
Pivot!

1478
01:11:05,167 --> 01:11:07,433
Pivot!

1479
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,733
Pivot!

1480
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,400
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1481
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:16,900
The thing about
that scene is it's so simple.

1482
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:19,800
If you were to see it
on the page initially,

1483
01:11:19,867 --> 01:11:23,000
it's three actors carrying
a couch up the stairwell.

1484
01:11:23,067 --> 01:11:25,800
There's maybe
a page of dialogue,

1485
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:28,633
and nothing really in that
dialogue suggests

1486
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,600
anything massively comic.

1487
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,500
But what they do in that time

1488
01:11:32,567 --> 01:11:34,867
in carrying
that couch up those stairs

1489
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:36,867
is one of the funniest things
I've seen on TV.

1490
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,300
Okay. Here we go.

1491
01:11:47,367 --> 01:11:48,633
Pivot!

1492
01:11:54,467 --> 01:11:55,767
Pivot!

1493
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,300
Alright, let's cut.

1494
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,367
Remember our marks?

1495
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:19,867
Do you remember
what color you were?

1496
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:21,233
- Yellow.
- Blue.

1497
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,200
- You're blue?
- I don't... I never looked down.

1498
01:12:23,267 --> 01:12:24,433
I always used the corner...

1499
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,267
- You looked.
- I used the corner...

1500
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,333
You tripped every time.
You wouldn't look.

1501
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,533
Wait, what happened?
I don't remember you tripping.

1502
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,933
The big... yeah.

1503
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,967
He ran in,
he looked at his mark...

1504
01:12:35,033 --> 01:12:36,700
- No, I tripped on that.
- He tripped.

1505
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:47,067
- He just fell...
- Every single time.

1506
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:50,600
- And I ran.
- You ran as fast as you could.

1507
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,133
But the second time I came in
and looked like this.

1508
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,867
I went like this the second
time. I came running.

1509
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:57,967
Phoebs, check it out, check it
out, check it out, check it out.

1510
01:12:58,033 --> 01:12:59,867
Phoebs, check it out.

1511
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,733
The third time, I went
to pull the chair over,

1512
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,200
and the chair fell over.

1513
01:13:07,267 --> 01:13:11,333
Phoebs, check it out, check it
out, check it out, check it out.

1514
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,067
Jesus.

1515
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:17,000
Sorry.

1516
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:19,067
And the final time, you came in.

1517
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:21,267
Because I was like,
"Somebody is getting a laugh.

1518
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,733
I can't handle it.

1519
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,300
I need to get... I need
to get a laugh too."

1520
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:27,800
Phoebs, Phoebs.

1521
01:13:27,867 --> 01:13:29,500
Check it out, check it out,
check it out, check it out.

1522
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:31,800
Oh, <i>Soap Opera Digest.</i>

1523
01:13:36,067 --> 01:13:38,400
Oh, no.

1524
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,200
That yeti is one smooth talker.

1525
01:13:46,267 --> 01:13:47,433
Yetis are smooth talkers.

1526
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,100
That's why, um...

1527
01:13:51,867 --> 01:13:53,500
Oh, these are bloopers?

1528
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:55,267
That yeti is one smooth talker.

1529
01:13:55,333 --> 01:13:56,667
Yetis are smooth talkers.

1530
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,400
That's why you never see
any pictures.

1531
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:06,333
He cannot play
at our wedding.

1532
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,700
Everyone will leave.

1533
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:09,667
It'll be like when he rapped
at my "butt" mitzvah.

1534
01:14:11,967 --> 01:14:13,300
Your "butt" mitzvah?

1535
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,833
Thank you.

1536
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,267
What?

1537
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,033
How can you keep
straight a face?

1538
01:14:39,467 --> 01:14:41,133
How much do you have
that's good?

1539
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,467
- None.
- None of it? Okay.

1540
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,733
I can't belie...
Oh, I just looked right at you.

1541
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,333
I'm so sorry.

1542
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,567
Action.

1543
01:14:51,633 --> 01:14:53,300
I can't believe
Emma's still asleep.

1544
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:55,233
I know.
What are we going to do?

1545
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:05,833
Ha-ha, I win.

1546
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,167
The is that?

1547
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:12,900
Ready?

1548
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:15,067
Ha-ha, I win!

1549
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:16,200
What is that?

1550
01:15:16,267 --> 01:15:18,200
That's fire,
you jagoff.

1551
01:15:23,567 --> 01:15:24,833
The game's over.

1552
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,367
Take off your robe.

1553
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:32,700
Okay, I mean...

1554
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:34,800
- No!
- No!

1555
01:15:34,867 --> 01:15:37,000
Do not take it off.

1556
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:40,900
That was his idea.

1557
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:42,933
Matty, that was your idea.
You remember that?

1558
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,500
She carries that
tray to the doctor

1559
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,000
because if she doesn't,
people die.

1560
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:58,100
Oh, no.

1561
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,767
Lisa, your laugh.
Oh, my God.

1562
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,200
No, it's the greatest thing
in the world.

1563
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,400
It's the most infectious laugh
in the world.

1564
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:06,933
- It's so cute.
- The most infectious sound.

1565
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,033
The bloopers were so funny.

1566
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:14,233
When you look back,
who had the loudest laugh?

1567
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,100
Who had the loud...
Oh, really?

1568
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,233
- Lisa.
- Really, Lisa Kudrow?

1569
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,067
- You had the loudest.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1570
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:21,400
- The best laugh.
- I can't help it.

1571
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:23,500
- The most enjoyable laugh ever.
- Oh, when Lisa laughs...

1572
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:26,433
Oh, my God.

1573
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,267
I can't believe
you didn't say me.

1574
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,367
Maggie Wheeler, everybody.
It's Janice.

1575
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,200
Mwah.
How are you?

1576
01:16:49,267 --> 01:16:51,133
Maggie Wheeler.

1577
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,800
Maggie, if you perch
on the corner here,

1578
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,967
Jen, you come back in,
everyone shift up.

1579
01:16:55,033 --> 01:16:58,133
Maggie, if you perch
in here for us.

1580
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,967
Thank you for being here,
Maggie.

1581
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:01,333
What an absolute thrill.

1582
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,967
Let's talk about Janice
for a moment.

1583
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:07,233
Where... Where did...

1584
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:10,733
Where did Janice come from?

1585
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,767
You know, I got the audition
sides across my fax machine,

1586
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:16,733
and it said
"fast-talking New Yorker,"

1587
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,100
and I thought, you know,
I know her.

1588
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,700
I-I grew up there.

1589
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:23,400
I-I just... She lives in me.
That's it.

1590
01:17:23,467 --> 01:17:27,033
You love me, Chandler Bing.

1591
01:17:30,967 --> 01:17:33,267
Oh, no, I don't.

1592
01:17:33,333 --> 01:17:34,933
You seek me out.

1593
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,333
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

1594
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,100
Janice, Janice.

1595
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:47,233
You want me, you need me,

1596
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,933
you can't live without me.

1597
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,600
Matthew Perry is so funny.

1598
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,767
And the minute I set eyes on him
and he opened his mouth,

1599
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:55,300
I thought, "Oh, God,
I'm gonna lose it.

1600
01:17:55,367 --> 01:17:56,767
I'm gonna crack up.

1601
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,833
This character needs a laugh
because I'm not gonna be able

1602
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:00,533
to get through a single scene
with this guy."

1603
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,333
And I just looked at him,
and I went

1604
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,567
And that was it.

1605
01:18:05,633 --> 01:18:07,433
It was just born in the moment.

1606
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:10,133
Thank you, Matthew,
for inspiring that.

1607
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,400
Anyway, everybody, oh, my God.

1608
01:18:13,467 --> 01:18:15,800
The "Friends" reunion.

1609
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:18,500
- And I get to be a part of it.
- Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1610
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:19,900
Thank you so much.

1611
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:22,067
Bless you.
Maggie Wheeler, everybody.

1612
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:26,700
What about that?
What a treat.

1613
01:18:29,567 --> 01:18:30,633
Oh, I love her.

1614
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,200
Now, I should say
there was somebody very,

1615
01:18:33,267 --> 01:18:35,833
very special involved
in the show

1616
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:37,600
who couldn't be here tonight

1617
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:41,333
but so desperately wanted
to be part of the show,

1618
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,567
he's joining us
on Zoom right now.

1619
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:48,433
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome James Michael Tyler.

1620
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,233
He's here.
It's Gunther.

1621
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,400
Gunther himself, everybody!

1622
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:53,967
He's here.

1623
01:18:54,033 --> 01:18:55,600
Hey, what's up, everybody?

1624
01:18:55,667 --> 01:18:57,867
How are you?

1625
01:18:57,933 --> 01:19:00,133
Good to see you.
You all look great.

1626
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,333
Tell us about your experience
making the show

1627
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,967
and how your character
just came to life

1628
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,800
over the course
of these seasons.

1629
01:19:07,867 --> 01:19:11,867
It was the most memorable
10 years of my life, honestly.

1630
01:19:11,933 --> 01:19:18,167
I could not have imagined
just a better experience.

1631
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:20,167
All these guys were fantastic.

1632
01:19:20,233 --> 01:19:21,700
It was just a joy
to work with them.

1633
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:23,700
I felt very, very special.

1634
01:19:23,767 --> 01:19:25,233
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

1635
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,767
When's your birthday?

1636
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,233
May 5th. Why?

1637
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,700
Oh, I-I'm just making a list
of people's birthdays.

1638
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:34,033
- Oh, mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

1639
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,167
Ladies and gentlemen,
James Michael Tyler,

1640
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:38,667
Gunther himself.

1641
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:42,433
Thanks.

1642
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,233
I mean, will you allow me
to ask

1643
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:50,167
what I would consider
to be a cheeky question?

1644
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:54,667
It's impossible not to realize
and see that you were all young,

1645
01:19:54,733 --> 01:19:59,333
hot, good-looking,
successful actors.

1646
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,467
And it's inconceivable to me
that there weren't

1647
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:07,100
perhaps off-screen romances.

1648
01:20:09,567 --> 01:20:12,333
Well, I mean, David?

1649
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,767
Yeah.

1650
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:17,100
- Yeah, I mean, the...
- The first season.

1651
01:20:17,167 --> 01:20:18,933
Yeah, the first season, we...

1652
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,567
I had a major crush on Jen.

1653
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:26,033
- I...
- It was reciprocated.

1654
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,200
And I think we both
at some point,

1655
01:20:27,267 --> 01:20:29,300
we were both crushing hard
on each other,

1656
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:31,433
but it was like
two ships passing

1657
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:35,533
because one of us
was always in a relationship.

1658
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,400
So... And we never crossed
that boundary.

1659
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,700
You know, we respected that.

1660
01:20:40,767 --> 01:20:42,667
- And... but we both...
- Bullshit.

1661
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,367
No, no.

1662
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:49,467
No.

1663
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,767
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1664
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:54,467
It's true. It's true.

1665
01:20:54,533 --> 01:20:57,700
Honestly, I remember
saying one time to David,

1666
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:01,033
"It's going to be such a bummer
if the first time you and I

1667
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:05,267
actually kiss is gonna be
on national television."

1668
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,800
Sure enough,
first time we kissed

1669
01:21:08,867 --> 01:21:11,433
- was in that coffee shop.
- Hang on, so...

1670
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:14,667
But so we just channeled
all of our adoration and love

1671
01:21:14,733 --> 01:21:16,900
for each other
into Ross and Rachel.

1672
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:21,133
Is this blowing
anyone else's mind?

1673
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,500
Wait. Hang on.

1674
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,500
That scene in the coffee house
when their first kiss,

1675
01:21:29,567 --> 01:21:33,267
I mean, that was like...
I watched it the other day,

1676
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,833
and I was weeping.

1677
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,700
The tension,
it was just palpable.

1678
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:40,800
The... It was just perfect.

1679
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:42,967
I'm so glad you guys didn't
because I don't know...

1680
01:21:43,033 --> 01:21:44,767
well, you would've
just been great actors.

1681
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,267
- But, man, that was something.
- Yeah, we were really

1682
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:47,400
just not great actors.

1683
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:54,700
Interior, coffee house
late that night.

1684
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:56,500
Rachel's putting up chairs.

1685
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:59,567
Ross enters agitated.

1686
01:21:59,633 --> 01:22:01,600
- Hi.
- I didn't get a cat.

1687
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:04,433
Oh. That's interesting.

1688
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,367
No, no, it's not interesting,
okay?

1689
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:09,500
It's very, very not interesting.

1690
01:22:09,567 --> 01:22:12,833
It's actually 100% completely
the opposite of interesting.

1691
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,300
Alright. Alright.
I get it, Ross.

1692
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:17,400
You had no right to tell me
you ever had feelings for me.

1693
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:19,600
- What?
- I was doing great with Julie

1694
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,267
before I found out about you.

1695
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,533
Hey, I was doing great
before I found out about you.

1696
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,533
You think it's easy for me
to see you with Julie?

1697
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,200
Well, then you should have
said something before I met her.

1698
01:22:30,267 --> 01:22:31,800
I didn't know then.

1699
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:33,900
And how come you
never said anything to me?

1700
01:22:33,967 --> 01:22:35,200
There was never a good time.

1701
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,833
Right,
because you only had a year

1702
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,933
and we only hung out
every night.

1703
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,067
Not... Not every night.

1704
01:22:42,133 --> 01:22:43,733
You know, and it's not like
I didn't...

1705
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,367
I didn't try, Rachel,
but things got in the way,

1706
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:48,967
you know, like...
like Italian guys

1707
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:54,200
or, uh, ex-fiancés,
or... or... or Italian guys.

1708
01:22:54,267 --> 01:22:57,767
Hey, there was one Italian guy,
okay?

1709
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,633
And do you even have a point?

1710
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,133
Yeah, the point is, I-I don't
need this right now, okay?

1711
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,133
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.

1712
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,933
Okay? I'm happy.
This ship has sailed.

1713
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,067
Okay, so what are you saying?

1714
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:10,367
You can just sort of
put away feelings

1715
01:23:10,433 --> 01:23:11,933
or whatever the hell it was
that you felt for me?

1716
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,333
Hey, I've been doing it
since the ninth grade.

1717
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,567
I've gotten
pretty damn good at it.

1718
01:23:14,633 --> 01:23:16,033
Alright, fine.
You go ahead and you do that.

1719
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,067
Alright, Ross?

1720
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:19,033
'Cause I don't need
your stupid ship.

1721
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,433
- Good.
- Good.

1722
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,967
And you know what?

1723
01:23:23,033 --> 01:23:24,867
Now I got closure.

1724
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,333
He storms out.

1725
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,833
Furious, Rachel locks the three
locks on the front door.

1726
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:48,167
Then she stops, leans on
a table and drops her head.

1727
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:50,600
When she looks up,
she's startled to see Ross

1728
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:53,267
at the door staring back at her.

1729
01:23:56,667 --> 01:24:00,867
They hold each other's gaze.

1730
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:04,300
She steps slowly towards
the door, then more quickly,

1731
01:24:04,367 --> 01:24:08,700
she unlocks the first lock,
the second, the third,

1732
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,767
and then goes to pull
the door open.

1733
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,933
Try... Try the bottom one.

1734
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:29,800
The door flies open,
Ross rushes in, grabs her,

1735
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:31,900
and they kiss.

1736
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:39,867
Yay!

1737
01:24:39,933 --> 01:24:43,167
- Ohh.
- That was good.

1738
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:46,167
I thought back on the very
first year or two, you know,

1739
01:24:46,233 --> 01:24:49,000
when we had breaks
from rehearsal,

1740
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:51,300
like, there were moments
we would, like, cuddle

1741
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:52,533
on a couch or something.

1742
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,867
We would spoon
and fall asleep on the couch.

1743
01:25:00,133 --> 01:25:01,600
And I'm thinking,

1744
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:02,967
"How did not everyone know

1745
01:25:03,033 --> 01:25:05,767
we had... were crushing
on each other?"

1746
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:07,233
We knew. We knew.

1747
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:08,600
Yeah, we knew for sure.

1748
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:10,300
Great. Now. Thanks.

1749
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,633
It was a situation
that we couldn't...

1750
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:20,067
we couldn't
do anything about it.

1751
01:25:20,133 --> 01:25:21,900
How great, though,
ultimately,

1752
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,900
'cause if you had
and it didn't work out,

1753
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:26,500
it would not have
probably been as great.

1754
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:35,333
I'm gonna go down
and ask each of you,

1755
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,967
and this is just a simple
yes or no answer.

1756
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:39,133
- Okay.
- Okay?

1757
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,300
Were Ross and Rachel on a break?

1758
01:25:42,367 --> 01:25:44,867
- Absolutely. Yes.
- Yes.

1759
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:47,233
- Yes.
- Yes.

1760
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,400
Yeah, we were on a break.

1761
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,200
Yeah.

1762
01:26:01,467 --> 01:26:04,133
We had amazing guest stars
on our show.

1763
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,800
Couldn't believe
all these people

1764
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:08,067
that we were all
massive fans of.

1765
01:26:08,133 --> 01:26:10,200
- Yeah.
- We had Danny DeVito.

1766
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:15,100
Did someone call
for the long arm of the law?

1767
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,767
- Oh, my God, was he funny.
- Oh, that was so funny.

1768
01:26:17,833 --> 01:26:20,200
- I remember... Oh, my gosh.
- Ben Stiller.

1769
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:22,400
Ben.
One of our biggest laughs ever.

1770
01:26:22,467 --> 01:26:24,800
Remember when Ben...
when we went over there?

1771
01:26:24,867 --> 01:26:26,333
What are you quacking about?

1772
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,500
Ooh, quack, quack, Donald Dodo.

1773
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,500
"You chickadee,
you little chickadoo."

1774
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:41,867
It was so funny.

1775
01:26:41,933 --> 01:26:43,633
I don't know
why it was so funny.

1776
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,867
- 'Cause he's funny.
- 'Cause of Ben Stiller.

1777
01:26:46,933 --> 01:26:49,367
- And Julia Roberts.
- Julia Roberts.

1778
01:26:49,433 --> 01:26:52,367
- That's right.
- And who enjoyed Julia Roberts?

1779
01:26:54,467 --> 01:26:55,600
Come on.

1780
01:26:57,767 --> 01:27:01,900
- Your fella Brad.
- Pitt came, did one.

1781
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,900
Rachel Green.

1782
01:27:05,367 --> 01:27:09,167
God, I hate her, Ross.
I hate her.

1783
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:14,333
And, of course, we had
one of my idols, Sean Penn.

1784
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,600
Aren't you gonna
give me a kiss?

1785
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:17,033
Okay, I will.

1786
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:18,900
But right after, you have to
tell me who the hell you are.

1787
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,467
And then we get the script
and, of course,

1788
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:24,633
I realize that "Oh,
I'm a... I'm a potato."

1789
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,733
- Hey.
- Hey.

1790
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,067
Oh, 'cause it was
the Halloween episode.

1791
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:30,200
So I had no...

1792
01:27:30,267 --> 01:27:32,733
like very little,
if any, dialogue with him.

1793
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,100
But here I'm thinking
"Greatest actor in the world,

1794
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,967
and I'm a potato.

1795
01:27:37,033 --> 01:27:38,067
I'm a potato."

1796
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:39,900
Oh, my God. You're Sputnik.

1797
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:41,733
Yes.

1798
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,467
Marry her.

1799
01:27:44,533 --> 01:27:48,833
Now, there's been some
incredibly memorable outfits

1800
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:53,033
and costumes over the 10 seasons
of "Friends,"

1801
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,700
and we thought we'd take a look

1802
01:27:55,767 --> 01:28:00,800
at some of those iconic costumes
right here tonight

1803
01:28:00,867 --> 01:28:05,533
with our very own
"Friends" reunion fashion show.

1804
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,900
Cue the music.

1805
01:28:08,967 --> 01:28:12,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

1806
01:28:12,267 --> 01:28:14,767
Cara Delevingne.

1807
01:28:16,733 --> 01:28:20,967
Cara is modeling
Rachel's bridesmaid dress

1808
01:28:21,033 --> 01:28:25,700
from Barry and Mindy's wedding
in Season 2.

1809
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,933
- Look at that.
- Yes.

1810
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,733
As far as
bridesmaid dresses go,

1811
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,733
it's actually quite understated.

1812
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:35,433
Modeling Ross's leather pants
from Season 5,

1813
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,700
it's Cindy Crawford.

1814
01:28:37,767 --> 01:28:39,300
Yeah!

1815
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:50,433
These are Ross's
incredibly tight pants,

1816
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,000
but once he got them on,
he couldn't get them off again,

1817
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:58,900
and I think we've all
been there.

1818
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:00,600
It's Sputnik time,

1819
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,267
and I know when
you think of Sputnik,

1820
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:06,400
you think of the one,
the only Justin Bieber.

1821
01:29:06,467 --> 01:29:07,833
- What?
- What?

1822
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:18,067
It's part Russian satellite,
part potato.

1823
01:29:18,133 --> 01:29:23,267
Look at that. Justin Bieber,
ladies and gentlemen.

1824
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:27,133
It's astonishing that he's even
managed to make that look cool.

1825
01:29:34,233 --> 01:29:37,867
And next up, perhaps the most
famous look of them all,

1826
01:29:37,933 --> 01:29:39,967
it's Santa's half-Jewish friend.

1827
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:44,133
It's the Holiday Armadillo.

1828
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,333
Cara Delevingne,
ladies and gentlemen,

1829
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,800
as the Holiday Armadillo.

1830
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:00,433
Oh, my God. That's amazing.
Whoo!

1831
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,500
This surely is a high point
in her modeling career.

1832
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,967
- Yeah, baby.
- Work it, work it!

1833
01:30:09,033 --> 01:30:11,300
That's amazing.

1834
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:12,567
And, ladies and gentlemen,

1835
01:30:12,633 --> 01:30:15,200
wearing all of
Chandler's clothes,

1836
01:30:15,267 --> 01:30:18,000
it's Matt LeBlanc!

1837
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,733
How did you do that?

1838
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:23,933
How did you do that?

1839
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:27,300
You are so cute.

1840
01:30:27,367 --> 01:30:28,700
Oh, my God.

1841
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:31,167
Could he be wearing
any more clothes?

1842
01:30:33,067 --> 01:30:34,500
Yeah, Matty!

1843
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,500
The "Friends" finale
and their farewell party.

1844
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:51,900
Tonight, the cast
is taping the last episode

1845
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:53,300
of their historic sitcom.

1846
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:54,567
Here I am
on the set of "Friends"

1847
01:30:54,633 --> 01:30:56,533
in Monica
and Chandler's apartment,

1848
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:01,667
where in just hours, the show
that made TV must-see must end.

1849
01:31:01,733 --> 01:31:04,767
If the show was about
that time in your life

1850
01:31:04,833 --> 01:31:06,433
when your friends
are your family,

1851
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,400
once you have family
of your own,

1852
01:31:09,467 --> 01:31:11,300
it's no longer that time.

1853
01:31:11,367 --> 01:31:14,533
So the show came,
I think, to a natural end.

1854
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,933
It was really important for us
to end everyone in a good place.

1855
01:31:22,867 --> 01:31:25,167
We wanted to know
that Monica and Chandler

1856
01:31:25,233 --> 01:31:27,300
were gonna have their babies.

1857
01:31:27,367 --> 01:31:28,533
Hey.

1858
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

1859
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:35,067
And that Phoebe was gonna
be happy and had a life.

1860
01:31:35,133 --> 01:31:36,600
I want one.

1861
01:31:36,667 --> 01:31:37,933
Oh, yeah?

1862
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,867
Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.

1863
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:43,033
There was some discussion
in the writers room

1864
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,500
about do we really want
Ross and Rachel to get together?

1865
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:50,800
- Rachel?
- I'm so sorry.

1866
01:31:50,867 --> 01:31:54,433
And we discussed perhaps
sort of ambivalent endings

1867
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:56,467
where it seemed like
down the...

1868
01:31:56,533 --> 01:31:58,933
and we went,
"No, this is 'Friends.'

1869
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,233
People have been
waiting 10 years

1870
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:03,233
to see this couple get together.

1871
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,567
We've got to give them
what they want.

1872
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:07,233
We just have to find
a way to do it

1873
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:08,800
so the journey is unexpected."

1874
01:32:08,867 --> 01:32:10,967
<i>Isn't there any way that you
could just let me off the...</i>

1875
01:32:11,933 --> 01:32:14,400
No! No!

1876
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:16,500
Oh, my God.
Did she get off the plane?

1877
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:18,033
Did she get off the plane?!

1878
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,333
I got off the plane.

1879
01:32:41,133 --> 01:32:42,700
Cut!

1880
01:32:55,933 --> 01:32:59,767
The night itself was
very difficult to get through.

1881
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:03,900
I really wanted to savor
every minute of it.

1882
01:33:03,967 --> 01:33:06,733
I knew it was going to end,
and I didn't want it to end.

1883
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,767
Adiós, arrivederci, au revoir.

1884
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,200
Take one, five cameras.

1885
01:33:15,133 --> 01:33:18,200
Okay, should we
get some coffee?

1886
01:33:18,267 --> 01:33:19,967
Sure.

1887
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:21,100
Okay.

1888
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:23,700
Where?

1889
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:37,033
And cut.

1890
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,000
The minute it was over...

1891
01:33:39,067 --> 01:33:40,300
Marta and I looked
at each other,

1892
01:33:40,367 --> 01:33:42,767
and I just kind of
went to pieces.

1893
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,800
Yeah, there was a lot of crying
that night.

1894
01:33:45,867 --> 01:33:48,533
I don't know how we got
through actual scenes.

1895
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,800
I remember that moment,
all of us up

1896
01:33:51,867 --> 01:33:54,267
at the end of the hall there.

1897
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:56,033
That was nice.
It was, like, private.

1898
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:58,333
Yeah.

1899
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,067
I feel emotional about it now
that I think about it.

1900
01:34:02,133 --> 01:34:08,800
It was not just the end
of a series.

1901
01:34:08,867 --> 01:34:12,500
It was the end of 10 years
of relationships.

1902
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:16,700
I mean, we were really,
really proud of the show,

1903
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:19,167
but like anything good,
it's sad when it's over.

1904
01:35:01,067 --> 01:35:05,933
That night, right after
I called wrap...

1905
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,433
Cut.

1906
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,867
...the sets immediately started
to be taken down

1907
01:35:09,933 --> 01:35:12,400
because there was a pilot
that was coming into

1908
01:35:12,467 --> 01:35:14,733
the stage the next day.

1909
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,033
That last day,
seeing them strike the set,

1910
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,233
it's like seeing someone
pack up your childhood home.

1911
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,133
It's gone.

1912
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,900
We ended up with
an impromptu party

1913
01:35:28,967 --> 01:35:31,933
where everybody just stayed
on set and sat there,

1914
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,033
and we ordered pizza and beer,
people signed the flats,

1915
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:42,133
and it was an incredibly
lovely, moving night.

1916
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:44,300
Did we all sign this
at the end?

1917
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,367
- Oh, we all signed this.
- Wendy.

1918
01:35:48,433 --> 01:35:51,300
- Oh.
- Carlos!

1919
01:35:51,367 --> 01:35:53,000
Oh, there's mine.

1920
01:35:53,067 --> 01:35:54,567
- What?
- What is it?

1921
01:35:54,633 --> 01:35:56,467
"I shit here."
That's right.

1922
01:35:59,767 --> 01:36:01,600
I knew it!

1923
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:04,033
Of course that's you.

1924
01:36:06,167 --> 01:36:08,433
"The best 10 years of my life.

1925
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,800
- Love to all."
- That's me.

1926
01:36:09,867 --> 01:36:10,700
- Oh, yeah.
- That's nice.

1927
01:36:10,767 --> 01:36:11,800
That is nice.

1928
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:13,100
- Marika!
- Not as nice as mine.

1929
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:14,300
No.

1930
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,767
We're here now,
all six of you.

1931
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:21,733
Lisa, has it crossed
your mind about, you know,

1932
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,133
well, maybe we could
do another episode,

1933
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,433
maybe we could do a movie?

1934
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,067
Is that something
you'd ever even contemplate?

1935
01:36:29,133 --> 01:36:31,500
No, no.

1936
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:33,267
I'm sorry. I haven't.

1937
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:37,000
No, because that's
all up to Marta and David,

1938
01:36:37,067 --> 01:36:38,600
and I once heard them say,

1939
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,233
and I completely agree,

1940
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:45,567
that they ended the show
very nicely.

1941
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,067
Everyone's lives are very nice,
and they would have to unravel

1942
01:36:49,133 --> 01:36:53,133
all those good things in order
for there to be stories.

1943
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,767
And, yeah, I don't want anyone's
happy ending unraveled.

1944
01:36:56,833 --> 01:36:59,500
Yeah.
Also at my age to be, say, like,

1945
01:36:59,567 --> 01:37:00,967
floopy, stop.

1946
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,533
- You have to grow up.
- Well, let me ask you this.

1947
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:10,600
Where do you think your
characters would be today?

1948
01:37:10,667 --> 01:37:11,967
Where's Rachel?

1949
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:15,133
Rachel. Rachel... I think
we're... did we get married?

1950
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,733
- Let's say we got married.
- Sure.

1951
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,467
Okay.

1952
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:21,533
I think we ended up getting
married, and we had some kids.

1953
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,000
- Kids, yeah.
- And you still played

1954
01:37:23,067 --> 01:37:24,367
- with bones.
- Still playing with bones.

1955
01:37:24,433 --> 01:37:25,900
Playing with bones, and...

1956
01:37:25,967 --> 01:37:27,167
That's paleontology.

1957
01:37:27,233 --> 01:37:30,200
Paleontology,
still a paleontologist.

1958
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:34,300
It gets Joey every time.
I don't know why.

1959
01:37:34,367 --> 01:37:35,533
Playing with bones.

1960
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,933
Playing with the bones.

1961
01:37:40,267 --> 01:37:41,900
So you guys are together.
You're happy.

1962
01:37:41,967 --> 01:37:43,733
- You've got kids.
- Yes.

1963
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,467
Where are Monica and Chandler?

1964
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:49,000
I think my character, Monica,
is still really competitive.

1965
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:51,500
Her kids are probably
not even in... you know,

1966
01:37:51,567 --> 01:37:53,000
they're probably graduated.

1967
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,900
But she still is in charge
of the bake sale

1968
01:37:55,967 --> 01:37:57,633
at, you know,
an elementary school.

1969
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,333
She's just got
to keep things going.

1970
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:01,600
PTA, you know.

1971
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,000
And you are making me
laugh every day.

1972
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:10,400
I just wanted to make sure
I factored in there somewhere.

1973
01:38:11,733 --> 01:38:13,067
And what's Phoebe doing?

1974
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:15,200
Phoebe's married to Mike.
They're probably in Connecticut.

1975
01:38:15,267 --> 01:38:16,433
They had kids.

1976
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,067
And I think she was like
the advocate for her kids,

1977
01:38:19,133 --> 01:38:21,333
who were a little different
and all the other kids

1978
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,533
who were just a little
different, you know?

1979
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,600
Creating the arts program and
the music thing and all that.

1980
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:27,767
Yeah.

1981
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,833
And where's Joey?

1982
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:32,567
I think he probably opened
a sandwich shop in Venice Beach.

1983
01:38:32,633 --> 01:38:33,733
Oh!

1984
01:38:35,167 --> 01:38:36,967
Oh, I wish he would.

1985
01:38:37,033 --> 01:38:39,033
- I wish he would
- Why not?

1986
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:41,200
I wish he would.

1987
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,033
Here's Courteney Cox.

1988
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,433
My sister on the show.

1989
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,400
Honest, this will
really make me cry,

1990
01:38:54,467 --> 01:38:57,733
but this will be the last time
that we're ever asked

1991
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,700
about the show as a group,
that we will do this.

1992
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:03,600
Like, we're not going to
do this again in 15 more years.

1993
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,000
I'll tell you one thing.

1994
01:39:06,067 --> 01:39:08,067
We are not waiting
so long to have a dinner.

1995
01:39:08,133 --> 01:39:11,567
No, we're not. We will not wait
that long to get together.

1996
01:39:13,367 --> 01:39:16,567
I have really enjoyed today.
I really have.

1997
01:39:16,633 --> 01:39:20,800
I didn't know, like, kind of
what to expect coming into this.

1998
01:39:20,867 --> 01:39:22,300
I knew it was going
to be awesome

1999
01:39:22,367 --> 01:39:26,767
to see these five people.

2000
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:31,467
What I did not take into account
was being back on the set...

2001
01:39:31,533 --> 01:39:32,733
- No.
- ...and in this environment.

2002
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:36,367
And it's... it's...

2003
01:39:36,433 --> 01:39:37,967
it's pretty cool.

2004
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,200
Yeah.

2005
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:43,133
Just please also state that
I don't cry like this

2006
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,600
when we get together
and have dinners.

2007
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:46,700
Yeah, no. Jen never cries.

2008
01:39:46,767 --> 01:39:49,133
No, I...

2009
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,200
I mean, it was
an incredible time.

2010
01:40:01,267 --> 01:40:02,767
Everything came together.

2011
01:40:02,833 --> 01:40:05,333
We became best friends who...

2012
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:07,233
just the chemistry,
the whole thing.

2013
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:09,800
It was life-changing,
and it forever will be.

2014
01:40:09,867 --> 01:40:11,933
Not just for us,
but for people who watch it.

2015
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,033
And that's just such a great
feeling to carry forever.

2016
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:19,900
I'm really thankful,
and I love you guys so much.

2017
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:22,700
I love you so much.

2018
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,267
- It's Courteney?
- It's Courteney.

2019
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,400
The best way that I can
describe it is

2020
01:40:50,467 --> 01:40:55,033
after the show was over,
at a party or any kind of

2021
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:58,367
social gathering, if one of
us bumped into each other,

2022
01:40:58,433 --> 01:41:00,533
that was it,
that was the end of the night.

2023
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,100
- You just...
- Sat with that person.

2024
01:41:02,167 --> 01:41:04,267
...sat with the person
all night long.

2025
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:05,967
That's true. I remember.

2026
01:41:06,033 --> 01:41:07,167
And that was it.

2027
01:41:07,233 --> 01:41:09,800
You apologized to
the people you were with,

2028
01:41:09,867 --> 01:41:13,367
but they had to understand you
had met somebody special to you

2029
01:41:13,433 --> 01:41:15,033
and you were going to talk
to that person

2030
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:17,200
for the rest of the night.

2031
01:41:17,267 --> 01:41:19,033
- And that's the way...
- I'm not laughing, I'm crying

2032
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:21,433
- because it's so true.
- That's the way it worked.

2033
01:41:30,767 --> 01:41:33,833
It's certainly the way it works
with all of us.

2034
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:36,000
It's just the way it is.

2035
01:41:36,067 --> 01:41:38,267
Mm-hmm.

2036
01:41:39,067 --> 01:41:40,767
I'm going to cry now.

2037
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:41,867
Good.

2038
01:41:41,933 --> 01:41:43,733
I've got a piece of a Kleenex.

2039
01:41:44,833 --> 01:41:46,200
Thanks. I'll take it.

2040
01:41:46,267 --> 01:41:47,700
